The Two Towers Tradition: The Second Century
WPI, the nation’s third oldest private technological university, was established in 1865 by the New England
industrialists John Boynton, Ichabod Washburn, and their associates. Boynton and Washburn endowed the <rst
two buildings on campus, as academic classrooms and practical shops. Boynton Hall and the Washburn Shops
— renovated today into state-of-the-art facilities — still preserve their distinctive original towers. These “Two
Towers” represent WPI’s continued commitment to academic excellence through real-life project experience
that synthesizes classroom learning.

The “Two Towers” tradition of academic achievement and practical application is re=ected in WPI’s motto, “Lehr
und Kunst” or “Theory and Practice.”

WPI has awarded graduate degrees since 1898, adding new programs regularly in response to the developing
needs of the professional world. WPI is among the top 50 science colleges in the nation in terms of the percent-
age of undergraduates who receive doctorates. Presently, WPI o9ers the master’s degree in 31 disciplines and
the doctorate in 15.

The current student body of over 4,000 men and women includes about 1,100 full- and part-time graduate
students. Currently, students attend WPI from almost every state and over 70 foreign nations.




WPI’s Commitment to Pluralism
Pluralism, as a social condition, means that several distinct ethnic, religious, and racial communities live side by
side, have equitable access to resources, are willing to a:rm each other’s dignity, are ready to bene<t from each
other’s experiences, and are quick to acknowledge each other’s contributions to the common welfare.
Recognizing the importance of pluralism to creativity, innovation, and excellence, WPI is dedicated to creating
an atmosphere that encourages diversity in all aspects of campus life–from academics, to residence hall living,
to social interactions among students, faculty, and sta9. The Institute recognizes the special obligation of
promoting a multicultural community based on mutual respect and tolerance. This commitment is part of WPI’s
institutional plan for encouraging pluralism and increasing diversity, a plan that proclaims the importance of
having students understand and appreciate other cultures, and prepares them fully to pursue rewarding careers
in an increasingly global economy. (Concepts endorsed by the WPI Faculty on April 21, 1994)

Undergraduate Education

A Statement of Values for Undergraduate Education at WPI
    1. WPI’s programs shall emphasize fundamental concepts, knowledge, and skill, and ensure that students are
       able to apply them within the context of their major disciplines.
    2. WPI’s programs shall emphasize the development of students as e9ective thinkers and communicators,
       able to use evidence to present their ideas with logic, clarity, and persuasion.
    3. Programmatic breadth in general, and balance between technical and humanistic components in
       particular, are the hallmarks of a WPI undergraduate education. In addition to educating students in their
       major discipline, WPI’s programs shall provide students with a broad preparation for ful<lling lives as
       responsible professionals and informed citizens.
    4. Grounded in project and course experiences, a WPI education shall provide a <rm foundation for life-long
       learning in a variety of <elds. WPI programs shall emphasize inquiry-based learning and open-ended
       problem solving. Students shall bear a considerable responsibility for learning outside of the classroom.
    5. WPI’s programs shall be su:ciently =exible so as to allow students signi<cant choice in and responsibility
       for planning their courses of study. Faculty, via the central teaching tasks of project and academic advising,
       shall ensure that student learning experiences encourage critical re=ection, decision making, and personal
       growth.
    6. WPI’s programs shall emphasize the scienti<c, technical, societal, and humanistic contexts in which
       knowledge is applied and constructed. Education activities shall challenge students to make connections
       between disciplines, to consider multiple viewpoints, and to appreciate the consequences of their actions.
       The curriculum shall prominently feature integrative and interdisciplinary activities.
    7. WPI’s learning environment and educational activities shall balance personal responsibility and individual
       accountability with cooperation, collaboration and mutual respect. Members of the community shall be
       encouraged to value academic integrity, and to become conscious of the value that such integrity confers
       to themselves and to the community.
    8. WPI shall be committed to assessment and improvement of student learning.

10. have the skills, diligence, and commitment to excellence needed to engage in lifelong learning.



The WPI Plan
In 1970 WPI adopted a revolutionary new undergraduate program known as the WPI Plan. The Plan replaced
the traditional rigidly-prescribed curriculum — typical of conventional engineering and science education —
with a =exible, exciting, and academically challenging program aimed at helping students to learn how to learn.
The Plan continues the “Two Tower” tradition by synthesizing classroom experience in projects that solve
realworld problems. The WPI project program prepares graduates for their future professional lives by helping

them learn how to identify, investigate and report on open-ended problems. Alumni indicate that project
experiences also prepare them uniquely well for managing team e9orts, and for communicating both in oral and
written forms according to professional standards.

All WPI students complete two major projects in addition to requirements in general education and in their
major <elds. The Major Qualifying Project (or MQP) challenges students to solve research and design problems
typical of those encountered in their professional discipline. The Interactive Qualifying Project (or IQP) presents
an issue at the intersection of science, technology, and culture, and emphasizes the need to learn about how
technology a9ects societal values and structures. Students also achieve intellectual breadth through degree
requirements in the social sciences and humanities and arts. In addition, students achieve some depth within the
Humanities and Arts by completing an Inquiry Seminar or Practicum on a theme emerging from a self-selected
series of courses. Taken together, these activities emphasize that professionals must learn not only to create
technology, but also to assess and manage the social and human consequences of that technology.

About Course Descriptions
Course Categories
For purposes of planning programs of study, courses at WPI are divided into three categories

Category I (Cat. I)
These courses cover core material of interest to large numbers of students. Category I courses are o9ered at
least once a year.

Category II (Cat. II)
Category II courses are o9ered at least every other year

Category III (Cat. III)
Category III courses are o9ered at the discretion of the department/program.


Background
Recommended
The course will build on material in the recommended course. Instructors can assume that the student is
knowledgeable of the material from the recommended course or from other experiences.



7                                                                                           WPI 2023-24 Catalog
Suggested
The material from this course would be helpful to the student, but it is not assumed background.


WRITING-INTENSIVE (WI) COURSE SECTIONS
Some sections of WPI courses may be labeled as “WI” in the course schedules. These sections will:

    • Assign writing to teach course content and disciplinary forms of communication and reasoning;
    • Provide explicit instruction in and feedback on students’ written work; and
    • Specify and require standards for ethical writing practices.


Catalog and Schedule
The catalog and course schedule can be found online at https://www.wpi.edu/academics/calendar-catalogs
and https://courselistings.wpi.edu.


Course Numbering
Each course at WPI is designated by a pre<x identifying the subject area followed by a four digit number. The
<rst digit is coded as follows:

1 — Courses for which <rst-year students will receive priority in registration. Upper class students may register
on a space-available basis.

2 — Basic level courses.

3 — Advanced level undergraduate courses for which no graduate credit is given. (This restriction may be
waived at the discretion of the degree department.)

4 — Advanced level undergraduate courses for which graduate credit may also be given.

5 — Graduate courses.

The last three digits may be used by the departments to indicate subject areas. Many graduate courses are also
available to undergraduates.


Course Credit
Unless otherwise indicated, WPI courses usually carry credit of 1/3 unit. This level of activity suggests at least
15-17 hours of work per week, including work outside the classroom, as well as scheduled class and laboratory
time. The usual workload per term is 1 unit.



Accreditation

Accreditation
Worcester Polytechnic Institute is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education (formerly
the Commission on Institutions of Higher Education of the New England Association of Schools and Colleges,
Inc.).

Accreditation of an institution of higher education by the Commission indicates that it meets or exceeds criteria
for the assessment of institutional quality periodically applied though a peer review process. An accredited
college or university is one which has available the necessary resources to achieve its stated purposes through
appropriate educational programs, is substantially doing so, and gives reasonable evidence that it will continue
to do so in the foreseeable future. Institutional integrity is also addressed through accreditation.



8                                                                                            WPI 2023-24 Catalog
Accreditation by the Commission is not partial but applies to the institution as a whole. As such, it is not a
guarantee of every course or program o9ered, or the competence of individual graduates. Rather, it provides
reasonable assurance about the quality of opportunities available to students who attend the institution.

Inquiries regarding the accreditation status by the Commission should be directed to the administrative sta9 of
the institution (gr-Accreditation@wpi.edu).

The aerospace engineering, architectural engineering, biomedical engineering, chemical engineering, civil

federal government eligibility guidelines in the administration of its institutional <nancial aid program.


Student Responsibilities for Ethical and Professional Conduct
WPI expects all its students to demonstrate the highest sense of honor in respecting academic and professional
traditions such as acknowledging the borrowing or use of other people’s ideas. Willful violations (like plagiarism)
of such academic traditions or of legal restrictions (like those regarding copyright) will be considered violations
of the “Campus Code” as described in the Student Planner.

WPI education is strongly committed to project-based learning, to providing students with access to state-of-
the-art technology, and to working with professionals, on and o9 campus. Therefore, when students are
exposed to proprietarial and/or con<dential information, they must accept responsibilities appropriate to their
preparation for life-long careers in which codes of ethics govern professional conduct.

Facilities such as the o9-campus projects, employment sites, and on-campus laboratories permit students to
gain experience with techniques at the forefront of industrial and research development. With this access



9                                                                                             WPI 2023-24 Catalog
comes the added responsibility of safeguarding students of any agreements they sign regarding conditions or
restrictions for access to certain equipment or information will also be considered a violation of the “Student
Code of Conduct”.

Record of any penalties assigned by the WPI Campus Judicial System which result from violation of standards
of ethical conduct will become a permanent part of that student’s disciplinary record.


Student Absence Due to Religious Beliefs
Section 2B, Chapter 151C of the General Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts: “Any student in an
educational or vocational training institution, other than a religious or denominational educational or vocational
training institution, who is unable, because of his/her religious beliefs, to attend classes or to participate in any
examination, study, or work requirement on a particular day shall be excused from any such examination or
study or work requirement, and shall be provided with an opportunity to make up such examination, study, or
work requirement which he/she may have missed because of such absence on any particular day; provided,
however, that such makeup examination or work shall not create an unreasonable burden upon such school. No
fees or any kind shall be charged by the institution for making available to the said student such opportunity. No
adverse or prejudicial e9ects shall result to any students because of his/her availing himself/herself of the
provisions of this section.”


Policy for Institutional Charges and Refunds for Students Called to Military Action
WPI recognizes the obligations of our students who are called to active duty by the U.S. Military. To support
these students WPI has established this policy to facilitate their transition from, and back to active student
status.

Such students shall receive 100% refund for the uncompleted term(s) of the semester at the date of the notice. If
such student has a loan obligation to WPI they will be granted an in-school deferment status during the period
of active duty service, not to exceed a total of three years.

To initiate the process to be classi<ed “On leave for military service” the student must indicate, in writing, that
he/she is requesting school deferment status while being called to active duty. A copy of the o:cial call to
active duty notice from the military must be included with this request and be submitted to the Registrar’s O:ce.

Transfer Students
WPI welcomes applications from full- and part-time transfer students from accredited two- and four-year
institutions. WPI looks for candidates with demonstrated strength in math, science, and computer or
engineering coursework; transfer admission to WPI is highly competitive. WPI's minimum academic requirement
for transfer admissions consideration is that candidates be enrolled in or recently completed precalculus and
one college-level laboratory sciences at the time of submitting an application. However, please note it is the
preference of the WPI admissions committee that the candidate complete calculus 1 and two college-level
laboratory sciences at the time of submitting an application. While not required, successful transfer candidates
have typically completed at least one full year of college (post high school graduation) by the time of intended
enrollment, and have earned grades of Bs or better. Transfer candidates must be in good academic and
disciplinary standing at all institutions in which they have been an enrolled student.

Applicants should be aware of the accelerated pace of WPI’s academic calendar, which consists of four, seven-
week terms instead of two semesters. A full-time course load is de<ned as three courses per term with classes
meeting four or <ve days per week, while a part-time course load may not exceed three total courses per
semester. A minimum of 8 units of work (or 72 credits) is the residency requirement for all students. Additionally,
candidates should be aware that undergraduate classes are only o9ered during the day.


Transfer Admissions & Financial Aid
The WPI Transfer Application is available online at www.wpi.edu/+transfer. The fall entrance application
deadline is May 15 with the review process typically beginning in late March each year. The spring entrance
application deadline is November 15 with the review process beginning as soon as possible in October. Students
are noti<ed of an admissions decision on a rolling basis. Accepted transfer students for the spring semester will
be required to enroll by December 15. Accepted transfer students for the fall semester will be required to enroll
by June 30.

In addition to submitting the WPI Transfer Application, transfer applicants should provide their o:cial college
transcripts for each post-secondary institution attended, a <nal o:cial high school transcript with proof of
graduation, and one letter of recommendation. Students o9ered admission and enrolling should be aware that
the WPI Conduct Record Release Form will be required prior to matriculation from any prior colleges/
universities attended. International transfer applicants must also submit English translations and course-by-
course evaluations from a current NACES member for all non-US transcripts, proof of English Language
Pro<ciency, and Proof of Financial Ability (if accepted to WPI) demonstrating funding for the total cost of
education and living expenses (an I-20 will not be issued without this form).

Additional detailed information about the transfer application process as well as a link to the WPI Transfer
Application can be found at www.wpi.edu/+transfer.

Transfer students may be eligible for need-based scholarship and loan funds from a variety of sources including
WPI, the federal government, and some state government agencies. Need-based <nancial assistance is not
available for part-time candidates or for international (non-U.S. citizen) transfer students. More information about
the need-based aid process as well as transfer scholarship opportunities are available at www.wpi.edu/+<naid.


Transfer Agreements & Transfer Credit
WPI currently holds formal articulation agreements with speci<ed programs of studies at Quinsigamond
Community College (QCC) in Worcester, MA. However, WPI will grant appropriate transfer credit from any
accredited two-year or four-year institution.

WPI will o9er a transfer credit evaluation post admission to the university for transfer students, and after the May
1 enrollment deadline for incoming <rst year students (typically beginning in mid-May). Admitted transfer
students and enrolled <rst year students should follow the WPI transfer credit guidelines, policy and procedure
available at www.wpi.edu/+transfercredit. This site also includes a list of transfer equivalencies to date based on
previously requested course reviews. The Transfer Admissions team coordinates the process with WPI faculty
who evaluate the coursework to determine credit eligibility. Each academic department at WPI reviews courses
under their program, and provides a decision to the Transfer Admissions team. Admissions communicates any
credit review updates to the student, the WPI Registrar’s O:ce and to WPI Academic Advising. In general,
courses that are the academic equivalent of a WPI course with a grade of a C or better will be considered for



13                                                                                           WPI 2023-24 Catalog
transfer credit, with many academic departments requiring a B or better. College-level and lab-based chemistry
and biology, calculus, calculus-based physics with lab, engineering science, and many social science and
humanities and arts courses are typically considered eligible for transfer credit. For most coursework to be
eligible for a transfer credit review, the coursework must be completed on a college campus taught by college
instructors. Some online coursework may be eligible and is determined as part of the o:cial course review
process by evaluators. Early college, early entrance programs, or college coursework provided in partnership
with a college or university but o9ered at the high school taught by high school teachers are not eligible for
credit at WPI, with the exception of Project Lead The Way (PLTW). Online coursework is also typically not
eligible, but is reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Additional courses that are not transferable include pre-
calculus, non-calculus based physics or engineering science, and computer courses in BASIC.

Humanities & Arts Requirement for Transfer Students
As part of the WPI Plan, all WPI students must complete the Humanities and Arts Requirement. As such, all
transfer students should review their humanities and arts coursework accepted for transfer credit at WPI and
plan with the Humanities and Arts Department’s coordinator for transfer students to determine next steps
towards the completion of the HUA Requirement. All transfer students entering WPI with fewer than two units of
humanities and arts credit must complete thematically related work in humanities and arts. This will include an
inquiry seminar or practicum to the extent that the overall humanities and arts credit totals two units. The HUA
Requirement is considered ful<lled for transfer students who have completed the equivalent of two units of
humanities and arts work prior to their matriculation at WPI. A Completion of Degree Requirement form (or CDR)
must be submitted once the HUA Requirement has been satis<ed. This form can obtained through the WPI
Registrar’s O:ce, and will be completed by the Humanities and Arts Department coordinator for transfer
students. For those transfer students who have satis<ed the HUA Requirement based on work completed at
their previous institution(s) and who submit the approved CDR form to the WPI Registrar’s O:ce will have this
information posted to their student account. This process normally takes place prior to or during the <rst term of
full-time enrollment at WPI.


International Students
The presence of international students serves as a means of strengthening the knowledge and understanding
of foreign countries and cultures and is highly encouraged and supported at WPI. Programs and support
services for international students and exchange programs are given high priority. As an institution of higher
learning, WPI is dedicated to international education.

International (non-immigrant) applicants must provide proof of English language pro<ciency. English language
pro<ciency may be demonstrated by the o:cial results of:

     • TOEFL (Test of English as a Second Language)- recommended score of 90 with no sub-score below 20
     • IELTS (International English Language Testing System) recommended score of 7.0 or higher with no band
       below 6.5
     • Duolingo - recommended score of 125
     • Pearson's Test of English - recommended score of 61




Financial Aid
WPI is committed to assisting students and their parents in <nding ways to <nance the cost of a WPI education
through <nancial aid assistance and private <nancing options. Central to WPI’s program is the concept of
<nancial need. This concept is based on the assumption that parents and students together accept the
responsibility for educational expenses to the extent they are able. Over 97% of full-time WPI undergraduates
are receiving <nancial help from federal, state, and/or institutional resources (includes need and merit based
aid). A combination of grants, loans and/or work study assistance from federal, state and WPI funding are
allocated to students who demonstrate <nancial need. The proportion of grant, or “gift” assistance, versus loan
and work, may be determined by the college on the following criteria: the magnitude of the <nancial need, the
student’s academic performance, and the availability of funds.

Application Procedures – Prospective Students
Students are required to <le the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and the CSS (College
Scholarship Service) Pro<le Application. In the case of separation or divorce, the student’s noncustodial parent
must also complete a CSS Pro<le. Students list WPI’s school code under the section on each form where it
designates which schools are to receive the form. In addition, students whose <nancial aid applications are
selected for veri<cation* are required to submit additional documentation for themselves and their parents, if
considered dependent. Generally, tax <lers are required to either successfully utilize the IRS’s Data Retrieval Tool
on the FAFSA or submit a copy of their tax return transcript. Non tax <lers are required to submit a copy of their
W-2 statements as well as a non-<ler statement from the IRS.

*Please visit www.wpi.edu/+faveri<cation for more information on the veri<cation process.

EARLY ACTION AND EARLY DECISION APPLICATION FOR FINANCIAL AID

Applicants must indicate on their admission application they are applying for <nancial aid. For those students
applying for early action admission, the CSS Pro<le Application (and CSS Pro<le from Noncustodial parent, if
applicable) can be submitted as early as October 1st, but no later than the posted Admission application
deadlines. The FAFSA and the CSS Pro<le Application are available online at
www.studentaid.gov and www.csspro<le.org.

Successful candidates for early action admission will be noti<ed of <nancial aid eligibility on a rolling basis.
Applicants will then have from the date of their aid eligibility letter until the candidates’ common reply date, May
1st, to either accept or decline the aid o9ered.

To learn more about early decision, please visit this webpage.

The Early Decision I deadline is November 1, with a noti<cation date of December 15.

The Early Decision II deadline is January 15, with a noti<cation date of February 15.

Early Decision is ideal for students who know that WPI is their <rst choice, and, after careful research and
consideration of all factors (residential, academic, social, and <nancial), are prepared to enroll at WPI if accepted.

REGULAR DECISION APPLICATION FOR FINANCIAL AID

Applicants must indicate on their admission application they are applying for <nancial aid. Successful candidates
for admission will be noti<ed of a <nancial aid decision in April if a complete <nancial aid application has been
submitted. Applicants will then have from the date of the <nancial aid decision until the candidates’ common
reply date, May 1st, to either accept or decline the aid o9ered.

To ensure a complete review, the WPI O:ce of Student Aid & Financial Literacy must receive the FAFSA and the
CSS Pro<le Application by February 15th. Applications completed after this date will be reviewed subject to
available funding. The O:ce of Student Aid & Financial Literacy encourages students to complete the FAFSA
and the CSS Pro<le Application (and CSS Pro<le from Noncustodial parent, if applicable), when the FAFSA and
CSS Pro<le Application open October 1st to ensure that WPI’s <ling deadline of February 15th is met.

UPPERCLASS APPLICATION FOR FINANCIAL AID

Upperclass students who receive need based <nancial aid must reapply for <nancial aid every year by
completing the FAFSA. In a few cases, some upperclass students will also be required to submit the CSS Pro<le
Application in addition to these requirements. Typically, upperclass students who will need to complete the CSS
Pro<le Application are those whose parents are recently separated or divorced, students who are re-admitted to
WPI, students whose custodial and noncustodial parents have changed since the prior academic year, and
students who did not apply for need based <nancial aid in the prior academic year. The WPI O:ce of Student
Aid & Financial Literacy reserves the right to request that a CSS Pro<le Application be completed by any
upperclass student applying for need based <nancial aid.

Filing information on the FAFSA (and CSS Pro<le Application, if necessary) is due by March 31st each year. In
addition, students whose <nancial aid applications are selected for veri<cation* are required to submit additional



15                                                                                             WPI 2023-24 Catalog
documentation for themselves and their parents, if considered dependent. Generally, tax <lers are required to
either successfully utilize the IRS’s Data Retrieval Tool on the FAFSA or submit a copy of their tax return
transcript. Non tax <lers are required to submit a copy of their W-2 statements as well as a non-<ler statement
from the IRS. The complete application provides consideration for grants, scholarships, loans and federal on-
campus employment for the following academic year. Students and their parent(s) are expected to obtain and
submit all requested forms in a timely manner for each year of planned enrollment. If any of the required forms
are submitted late, there will be a delay in the student receiving an aid o9er and there may be a reduction in
his/her grant or scholarship eligibility for the year in which he/she is applying for need based <nancial
assistance. The amount of <nancial aid upperclass students receive will depend on their academic performance
from the prior academic year, their family’s demonstrated <nancial need which is determined from the FAFSA,
and the CSS Pro<le Application, if required.

*Please visit www.wpi.edu/+faveri<cation for more information on the veri<cation process.

TRANSFER STUDENTS

Transfer students may apply for <nancial aid eligibility beginning with their <rst term of matriculation and must
indicate interest in <nancial aid on the admission application. Please note that <nancial aid is not available for
part-time or international (non-U.S. citizen) transfer students. Transfer aid applications will be reviewed based on
the same documentation required for <rst year applicants and are packaged on a funds available basis. The
FAFSA and CSS Pro<le (and CSS Pro<le from Noncustodial parent, if applicable) are due by May 15. In addition,
students whose <nancial aid applications are selected for veri<cation* are required to submit additional
documentation for themselves and their parents, if considered dependent. Generally, tax <lers are required to
either successfully utilize the IRS’s Data Retrieval Tool on the FAFSA or submit a copy of their tax return
transcript. Non tax <lers are required to submit a copy of their W-2 statements as well as a non-<ler statement
from the IRS.

Forms of Aid
FEDERAL PELL GRANTS

Federal Pell Grants are awarded to high-need students from low, and lower, middle-income families. For the
2022-2023 academic year (July 1, 2022, through June 30, 2023) the maximum Federal Pell Grant will be $6,895.
The amount an individual student may receive depends on a number of factors (including the Expected Family
Contribution, cost of attendance and enrollment status).

FEDERAL SUPPLEMENTAL EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY GRANTS (FSEOG)

The Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant is a Federal grant awarded to low income,
undergraduate degree-seeking students who are also Federal Pell Grant recipients. Award amounts range per
academic year and will not exceed $4,000 per year. Awards are based on the availability of funds. The funding is
provided to WPI from the federal government. This grant is for one year only and is not guaranteed in
subsequent years. Funding is limited.

FEDERAL DIRECT STUDENT LOAN

For information on loans, including the Federal Direct Loan programs, WPI institutional loans, and private
education loans available to families please visit our website (https://www.wpi.edu/admissions/tuition-aid/
types-of-aid/loans-<nancing).

FEDERAL WORK STUDY PROGRAM

For more information on Federal Work Study (FWS), please visit this website (https://www.wpi.edu/admissions/
tuition-aid/types-of-aid/federal-work-study-program). Awarded students will be sent additional information by
the O:ce of Student Aid & Financial Literacy to their WPI email address about working on campus
shortly before each academic year begins. Federal Work Study is not available in the summer terms. Obtaining a

FWS position (and completing the required community service earnings), either on-or o9-campus, is the
responsibility of the student. There is a minimum requirement of earnings that must be achieved each academic
year - which is one of the requirements for retaining funding in the subsequent academic year.

STATE SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAMS

The MASSGrant is awarded to Massachusetts residents whose combined family contribution falls within state-
determined parameters. Students must <le the FAFSA by the state-designated deadline and follow all state
program procedures to apply.

Massachusetts has reciprocity agreements with Pennsylvania and Vermont. These states allow their residents
attending institutions in Massachusetts to “carry” need-based state grants into Massachusetts. Awarding from
other state scholarship programs depends on annual state funding levels.

The Massachusetts Gilbert Matching Grants Program is allocated annually to WPI. These funds are awarded to
Massachusetts residents who fall within a certain <nancial need.

Learn more here: https://www.wpi.edu/admissions/tuition-aid/types-of-aid/scholarships-grants.

STATE FUNDED STUDENT LOAN PROGRAMS

The Commonwealth of Massachusetts provides the Massachusetts No Interest Loan (MA NIL) Program through
annual allocations to participating colleges and universities. Students who <le the FAFSA and meet state
eligibility criteria are eligible for the Massachusetts No Interest Loan on a funds available basis.

WPI COLLEGE SCHOLARSHIP

WPI awards College Scholarships and other restricted or endowed “gift” assistance, to students who have a
demonstrated <nancial need based on review of the completed <nancial aid application, including the FAFSA,
the CSS Pro<le Application (if <rst year applicant), IRS Data Retrieval Tool, and W-2 forms (if selected for
veri<cation). WPI gift aid may be combined with federal and state grants to make up a student’s total portion of
“gift” assistance, before loans and work are packaged.

WPI INSTITUTE STUDENT LOAN PROGRAM

The WPI Institute Loan is an institutional need-based loan awarded to students. Repayment of the principal and
interest begins 9 months after the last day of enrollment or withdrawal from college. Learn more here.

FEDERAL DIRECT PLUS LOANS

Federal Direct PLUS Loans are available annually to parents of dependent undergraduate students. Repayment
begins when the funds are advanced to the school with the option to defer repayment until after the student
graduates or falls below half-time enrollment status. Parents have 10 years to repay the Federal Direct PLUS
Loan. Learn more here.

WPI DEPARTMENT-FUNDED WORK PROGRAM

Students who are not eligible for Federal Work Study funds may seek employment opportunities through
departments or o:ces on campus that set aside funds for hiring undergraduate employees. These employment
funds vary from year to year in terms of monies available or the number of students allowed per department/
o:ce. Students may also inquire about department-funded summer positions on campus.


Financial Aid Policies
Financial aid is awarded one year at a time. Aid applicants are required to reapply annually by the end of the
academic year for the next academic year. A student's <nancial need is reviewed annually through the FAFSA to
ensure that aid is renewed equitably, as di9erent circumstances may cause needs to change. The WPI O:ce of
Student Aid & Financial Literacy determines a student’s <nancial need through a review of the completed
<nancial aid application.




17                                                                                          WPI 2023-24 Catalog
Financial aid o9ers are made available in the student's portal (www.wpi.edu/+fastatus) in July for the following
academic year. If an aid o9er is not available when a student anticipates receiving one, contact the o:ce to
determine why - <naid@wpi.edu or 508-831-5469.

Students should monitor their WPI email and check their portal for missing documents or requirements
throughout the summer. If a student is selected for veri<cation, the O:ce of Student Aid & Financial Literacy will
not review the student for awarding until they submit all veri<cation documents and are veri<ed. Please visit
www.wpi.edu/+faveri<cation for more information on the veri<cation process.

STUDENT CONTRIBUTION

It is expected that the student’s family will contribute its maximum <nancial e9ort and that the student will also
make a maximum e9ort through savings from annual earnings, and by accepting a proportion of <nancial aid in
the form of loans and/or in-school employment, if eligible. Students at WPI are expected to contribute a
minimum $2,750 each academic year from summer or other annual earnings. While this minimum student
contribution is used, the WPI O:ce of Student Aid & Financial Literacy must review previous calendar year
student earnings and student savings/assets as the basis for determining the annual student contribution.

INDEPENDENT/DEPENDENT STUDENT STATUS

WPI believes that the primary responsibility for an undergraduate education lies with the student and parent(s),
to whatever extent possible. Therefore, all undergraduates applying for WPI institutional funds are required to
provide parental information regardless of federal dependency status.

Although a student may meet federal guidelines to be considered an independent student, and therefore
receive federal funds as an independent student, the ability of parents to assist their children, regardless of age
and dependency status, is a factor WPI considers in determining eligibility for institutional need-based grants.
Because of this, the WPI O:ce of Student Aid & Financial Literacy will require parental information from all
students applying for need based institutional aid.

AID RETENTION/PROGRESS TOWARD A DEGREE

The Institutional (WPI) <nancial aid retention policy is found here.

All full time students are expected to register and enroll in the equivalent of 36 credits (12 classes) each
academic year*.

A student must pass a minimum of 24 academic credits each academic year (A through D term) to keep the
same level of WPI institutional funding for the following academic year.

AP courses, transfer credit, incomplete grades or extensions are not counted in the number of credits passed. The
student is responsible for resolving any incomplete grades with the faculty member assigning the grade.

If a student does not meet the minimum number of academic credits required in an academic year (A-D term),
their WPI merit based scholarships will be reviewed and a percentage of their merit scholarship may be
reduced based on the number of courses they did not pass.

Reductions to WPI merit-based scholarships begin at having passed only 21 credits, which results in a 5%
decrease in funding. WPI merit-based scholarships will continue to be reduced by 5% for every 3 credits not
passed.*

Students are able to submit an appeal due to a loss of funding related to their academics. Please reach out to
<naid@wpi.edu to obtain the appeal form.

*There are exceptions for students on an approved reduced course load, participating in a Co-Op experience, or
returning from a Leave of Absence, for example.

WPI Need Based Scholarships
WPI need based scholarships awarded to students will not increase in future academic years regardless of
changes in a student’s <nancial need. However, student’s WPI need based scholarships may decrease based on
a lower <nancial need and/or poor academic performance (from the prior academic year).

WPI Merit Scholarships
WPI merit scholarships will not increase or decrease based on changes to a student’s <nancial need. However, a
student’s merit scholarship will decrease or be eliminated if a student does not pass a minimum of 24 academic
credits per year.

Eligibility for consideration for all types of <nancial aid for the following academic year is lost if a student is
placed on Academic Probation (D term). If a student is placed on Academic Probation, they may submit an
appeal form. Please email <naid@wpi.edu to learn more and obtain this form.

Financial Aid Appeals
Students placed on Academic Probation, have lost a portion of or all of their merit scholarship and/or are
placed on federal <nancial aid suspension, may in some cases which involve unusual and extenuating
circumstances such as documented medical problems, <le a <nancial aid petition with the WPI O:ce of Student
Aid & Financial Literacy.

Financial Aid Appeals can be obtained in the WPI O:ce of Student Aid & Financial Literacy or online here.

The appeal will be reviewed by the Financial Aid Appeal Committee. Determination on <nancial aid appeals will
be made on a case by case basis.

 1. Regardless of academic progress status, eligibility for WPI <nancial aid (including the merit scholarship) is
    available for the shorter of the two following periods: 16 terms (4 years) of enrollment at WPI, as a full time
    or part-time student, (NOT 16 terms of receiving <nancial aid), or completion of your Bachelor Degree
    requirements at WPI.
 2. Students must be enrolled full time (minimum of 12 credits per semester) to be eligible for WPI need based
    and merit based scholarship funding, as well as most federal and state grant programs and work study. A
    student is considered to be a full time student if they are being charged full time tuition and fees. Students
    are responsible for knowing their enrollment status and should enroll in the number of credits per year
    necessary to maintain their aid eligibility.

PLEASE NOTE: With the exception of the Federal Direct Loan, the Federal Pell Grant, and the Global Scholarship
- <nancial aid is not available for enrollment during term E (Summer School) at WPI. This includes all forms of
assistance including WPI merit scholarships.

If you enroll during term E, and request to borrow a Federal Direct Loan, the amount you borrow will be based
on the student's Federal Direct Loan eligibility within the prior academic year (terms A-D). Federal Pell Grant
eligibility will be based on enrollment and eligibility within the prior academic year (terms A-D).

*there are exceptions such as students on an approved reduced course load. Please contact the O2ce of Student
Aid & Financial Literacy if you have concerns.

INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS

International students (who do not have o:cial documentation of Permanent Residence Status in the United
States) are ineligible for all sources of federal and state aid administered by the WPI O:ce of Student Aid &
Financial Literacy. Limited scholarships are available for entering international students through the WPI O:ce
of Student Aid & Financial Literacy.


Alternative Financial Programs
Alternate <nancing programs are available to many students and their families who do not apply for aid or who
need additional resources beyond federal, state, and institutional <nancial aid o9ered. WPI o9ers a payment plan
through the Bursar's O:ce. Learn more here: https://www.wpi.edu/o:ces/bursar/payment.


19                                                                                                WPI 2023-24 Catalog
There are many long-term <nancing programs available to assist students and their families in spreading their
educational costs over 10 to 20 years. Many of these loans allow students and their families to borrow the
di9erence between the cost of attendance determined by the college and total <nancial aid received for the
academic year.

Please contact the WPI O:ce of Student Aid & Financial Literacy or visit.

FEDERAL Parent PLUS LOANS

Federal Parent PLUS Loans are available annually to parents of dependent undergraduate students. Repayment
begins when the funds are advanced to the school with the option to defer repayment until after the student
graduates or falls below half-time enrollment status. Parents have 10 years to repay the Federal PLUS
Loan. Learn more here. This loan must be re-applied for each year.

Awards, Conditions and Notes
As a student receiving merit and/or need-based funding at WPI, students are responsible for reviewing WPI’s
Award Conditions and Notes document each year to make sure they understand the renewal criteria for the
fund(s) in their <nancial aid o9er.

If there are any questions about the information provided in this document, please contact the WPI O:ce of
Student Aid & Financial Literacy at <naid@wpi.edu. The document is updated annually and found here.


Financial Aid Upon Withdrawal/Leave of Absence/Suspension
Students who withdraw, take a leave of absence, or are suspended from WPI and are receiving any type of
<nancial aid should review the policy on Withdrawal or Leave of Absence found here: https://www.wpi.edu/
admissions/tuition-aid/policies.

Leaving WPI because of an approved o:cial or uno:cial withdrawal, leave of absence or suspension may have
an impact on a student’s <nancial aid package. Early noti<cation to the WPI Registrar’s O:ce will help ensure
that student’s <nancial aid is appropriately recalculated, and that any required adjustments are made to the
student’s account as soon as possible.

No classes passed in a term:

If a student who receives federal <nancial aid fails to earn a passing grade in at least one course during a term
(and does not o:cially withdraw from the institution), federal regulations require WPI to assume that the student
has uno:cially withdrawn from the institution. WPI must recalculate the student’s federal aid eligibility for the
semester unless the student can provide documentation from their professors that they completed the term but
simply failed to earn a passing grade.



20                                                                                         WPI 2023-24 Catalog
Recalculation of each student’s <nancial aid package will be unique and is dependent on many factors (e.g., time
of withdrawal, charges incurred, and <nancial aid package components); therefore, students are encouraged to
contact the WPI O:ce of Student Aid and Financial Literacy at 508-831-5469, for any questions or concerns.

21                                                                                            WPI 2023-24 Catalog
WPI sends a noti<cation to the WPI email address assigned to each student when semester charges are
available to view. Fall charges are available to view at the beginning of July and Spring charges are available to
view at the beginning of December. When viewing your <nancial account in Workday, you will <nd an option to
print or create a pdf statement for the semester. It is important to view your <nancial account in Workday
frequently for any current changes.

Tuition must be paid in full by the speci<ed due date provided you in the emailed semester noti<cation, which is
also found on the semester statement you can create from within your account. Students that register after the
due date are required to pay at the time of registration. Students remit payment online with a checking account
(no fee) or via credit card (2.85% fee). For international credit card or domestic and international wire payments
visit WPI's Flywire page. For information on payment options, please visit the Bursar webpage.

For E-Term (Summer) charges are available to view in your <nancial account in Workday at the beginning of
April. E-Term typically has two due dates, an E1 due date around second week of May, and an E2 due date
around second week of July. If a student registers after either due date, payment is due at the time of
registration.

Non-matriculated students, (not enrolled in a WPI degree program) payment is due at the time of registration.
Failure to pay will result in being dropped from any course(s).


Financial Obligations, Holds, and Late Fees
*The college reserves the right to hold grades, o:cial transcripts, registration for any student who has an
outstanding <nancial obligation with the college.

Late fees, up to $250, will be assessed on balances not paid by the due date.

A student may be administratively withdrawn due to an outstanding <nancial obligation for a term, which may
require the student to apply for <nancial re-admission.

Students who elect to petition any charge on their Student Account must do so in writing prior to the <nal day of
classes in the respective term (B term for Fall or D term for Spring). No late petition will be reviewed or approved
if submitted after a term has commenced.

Failure to pay your <nancial obligation may result in the account being referred to an outside collection agency
and reported to a credit bureau agency, which will negatively a9ect your credit rating. You will be responsible
for all costs associated with the collection of this debt to the maximum amount allowed by Massachusetts
general statutes.

* WPI fully supports the Veterans Bene<ts and Transition Act of 2018. Sec. 103 amends US code to prevent
schools from penalizing Ch. 31 or 33 students if/when the VA is late making payments. WPI policy supports and
agrees to the VA recommendations of the following while waiting for VA payments: WPI agrees to not prevent
enrollment, charge a late penalty fee(s), require alternative or additional sources of funding or deny access to
school resources.


Overload Charges
There will be a tuition surcharge on registration which contains academic overloads in excess of 21/3 (7/3) units
per semester. Wellness and Physical Education and Military Science are not included in the determination of
overloads. The overload charge will be based upon the total registration credit held by the student at the close
of the initial course change period in B- and D-terms. (Please consult the Registrar’s O:ce or the O:ce of the
Bursar for current fees.) Fall overload billing will take place during Term B and spring overload billing during
Term D. The current Term E charge system will not be a9ected.

Withdrawal week 11 and after         100%


To qualify for a tuition charge adjustment, students must submit an O:cial Withdrawal form to the Registrar’s
O:ce. The date of the student’s last date of attendance determines the charge.

There is no adjustment in tuition/fees in the case of withdrawal from individual courses.

Students who have paid full tuition for eight semesters may be allowed to enroll as part-time students on a per-
course basis and be charged tuition accordingly. (Two summer terms enrolled as a full-time student may be
counted as a semester.) Students must submit the Application for Part-time Status to the Registrar’s O:ce at
least two weeks before the beginning of the fall or spring semester.

Health insurance, health fee, and social fee are neither pro-rated nor refunded.

After all adjustments have been made, any balance due to WPI is payable immediately.

Housing
Residence Halls
WPI provides its undergraduate students with a variety of housing options. The WPI residence halls o9er <rst
year students housing in double and triple occupancy rooms as well as suites designed for four to eight people.
A limited number of singles for students with documented need through the O:ce of Accessibility Services are
available. (Residence hall living at WPI o9ers opportunities that can be a valuable part of higher education.)


23                                                                                          WPI 2023-24 Catalog
First-year students admitted for Term A, who meet all application deadlines, are guaranteed housing in the
residence halls for that entire academic year. The Housing & Residential Experience Center works to
maximize the opportunities available for upper-level housing. Some options include townhouses, apartments,
and residential houses. O9 campus housing alternatives include rooms in homes, apartments and commuting
from home. Additionally, for fraternity and sorority members there is Greek chapter housing available. Upper-
level students are not guaranteed on-campus housing. The Housing and Dining Contract is a legally binding
contract which extends from the beginning of Term A through Term D as long as the student is enrolled at WPI.


Residence Hall Sta6
Resident Advisors (RAs) and Graduate Housing Assistants (GHAs) are the core of the residential life sta9 in the
residence halls. RAs serve as a source of assistance in resolving students’ academic, personal, and social
concerns. They plan and implement social and educational programs in the halls and enforce all WPI policies
and regulations in an e9ort to develop an e9ective residential community in the residence halls. The
administrative responsibility for the operation of the residence halls rests with the professional sta9 in the
Housing & Residential Experience Center, speci<cally the Community Directors (CDs) who supervise and work
with the RAs and GHAs. They counsel and advise students, work with maintenance and dining hall sta9s, and
handle many administrative processes for students living on campus.


Occupancy
Opening and closing dates of the residence halls are posted on the Housing & Residential Experience
Center website as they are determined. Students will also receive email communication with move in
information ahead of each process. Housing and food service privileges are not transferable, nor may any
person take up de facto residence without paying rent. The traditional residence halls will be closed during the
Winter Break period.


Furnishings and Facilities
Students are responsible for the neatness and cleanliness of their rooms. Residence halls are furnished with a
twin-size bed, a desk and chair, closet space, and drawer space for each student. All residence halls are smoke-
free environments. Data network services and a movie streaming service are included in room rates. Residents
provide their own pillows, linens, blankets, and other personal furnishings.

Mobile pay laundry facilities are available on the campus.

The following are some things not permitted in the residence halls:

     •   Sale, use or possession of illegal drugs
     •   Pets, except small <sh
     •   Refrigerators larger than 4.3 cubic feet in size, 3D printers
     •   Gambling
     •   Use of alcoholic beverages in violation of Massachusetts State Laws
     •   Firearms, weapons, explosives, incendiary or toxic chemicals, starting pistols, paint ball guns, knives
     •   Cooking, except in kitchen areas provided
     •   Candles or other =ame-emitting devices
     •   Smoking of any kind

For a complete copy of the housing and dining contract, please visit the WPI website.


Mail & Packages
Mail and express packages should be addressed to the student by name, and box number, WPI, 100 Institute
Road, Worcester, MA 01609-2280. Please visit the Mail Services website https://www.wpi.edu/o:ces/mail-
services for more detailed information.


Roommates
One of the most memorable aspects of campus life can be the relationship you will build with your roommate(s).
Roommates often <nd that a meaningful relationship is developed through good communication. We


24                                                                                               WPI 2023-24 Catalog
encourage you to be as open as possible so that you and your roommate can begin early to create a
relationship based on respect and understanding. This relationship can help make residence hall living one of
the most enjoyable part of your college career.


Room Charges
Room Rates can be found by CLICKING HERE (Note: Room rates are shown for the entire academic year or per
semester)

First Year Residence Halls & Houses:
Daniels, Founders, Institute, Messenger, Morgan, Riley, Stoddard, Trowbridge House, Wachusett House, and WPI
Townhouses.

Payment for housing and food service fees are made in two installments, one each at the beginning of Terms A
and C. Reduced charges, if applicable, will be processed according to the established withdrawal policy of the
college. Students entering the residence halls other than at the beginning of Term A or C will be issued a
prorated billing for the period. This bill must be paid in full prior to occupancy.

Students are expected to care for the physical facilities of the residence halls. Damage to the facilities beyond
the normal wear and tear shall be the <nancial responsibility of the residents. Damage to common areas of the
residence halls will be divided among residents of that wing, =oor, or building.

First year students can expect to receive a link to the Housing Portal in May, after their $500 tuition deposit is
received by the O:ce of Admissions. First Year students should be prepared to select their housing through the
online housing selection portal in early to mid-July.


Meals
All <rst-year students and upper-level students residing in South Village are required to participate in a
residential meal plan. All other students are welcome to purchase a meal plan as well. The MEAL PLANS are a
combination of traditional meal swipes plus additional funds to be utilized at the student’s discretion.

Once a student has contracted for food service, this is a legally-binding agreement, and students are obligated
to assume <nancial responsibility for the entire academic year.

Board Plan Rates can be found by CLICKING HERE (Note: Board plan rates are shown for the entire academic
year or per semester)

O6-Campus Living
After the <rst year, on-campus housing is not guaranteed. If you decide to look for an o9-campus apartment,
make plans well in advance. Information is available on the WPI website for you to research questions about
housing codes, leases, tenants’ rights, etc. The following are a few hints for you as you begin your search for o9-
campus housing.

Leases: Contract periods for o9-campus housing vary in length, from twelve-month and nine-month to summer
only and three-month leases. As you consider various places, <nd out what types of leases are available.




25                                                                                           WPI 2023-24 Catalog
Be Prepared: You’ll want to plan realistically for expenses such as utilities, transportation, repairs, laundry, and
food. Also, try to pick your roommates carefully and ahead of time.

Lodging Laws
You should also be aware that the City of Worcester has a zoning code that prohibits more than three unrelated
persons living together unless the landlord or owner has obtained a lodging house license.


Policies & Procedures

Academic Policy

Grading Policies
Distribution of Grades
Academic grades of undergraduate students may be released to parent(s) of a student claimed as a dependent
for tax purposes. WPI presumes that all undergraduate students are dependents of their parent(s) unless they
<le a Declaration of Independent Status petition form with the Registrar’s O:ce. These forms are available in the
Registrar’s O:ce. After the Registrar’s O:ce receives a Declaration of Independent Status petition form from an
undergraduate student, the O:ce will not release the student’s academic grades to the parent(s) of such
student until such time as the student rescinds their Declaration, in writing <led with the Registrar’s O:ce, or his/
her parent(s) provide acceptable proof of tax-dependent status to the Registrar’s O:ce. The Registrar's O:ce
will keep a record of any release of grades directly to the parent(s) of a dependent student in that student's
record, and the student will be able to review that record.


Grading System
Projects: The following term grades are possible: A, B, C, SP (Satisfactory Progress), NAC (Not Acceptable) and
NR (No record).

Courses: The following grades are possible: A, B, C, NR, and I (Incomplete). An instructor may also assign an “I” in
an Independent Study course. AT (attended) is used to denote participation in seminars or college-sponsored
programs. If an undergraduate student repeats a course previously graded with an A, B or C, both grades will
appear on the undergraduate student transcript with the lower grade marked with a ‘/R’ indicating a repeated
class. Only the higher grade will be used to calculate the student’s numerical equivalent.

Students such as Consortium (CO), nondegree-seeking students, and Graduate students will receive traditional
A, B, C, D, F, Withdrawal and Pass/Fail grades.


Grades for Completion of Degree Requirements
The overall evaluation of degree requirements (for the MQP, the IQP and the Humanities and Arts Requirement)
will be graded in the student’s respective grade system. The transcript will contain an abstract describing the
content of the completed project.

No Record (NR)

The NR (No Record) grade is assigned by a faculty member for course or project work for which credit has not
been earned. This grade applies to PLAN students (admitted, degree-seeking) only. The NR grade does not
appear on the students’ transcripts or grade reports.

Incomplete (I)




26                                                                                              WPI 2023-24 Catalog
An I grade, when assigned, will be changed to NR after one term unless extended in writing by the instructor to
the Registrar’s O:ce. The I grade is not assigned for Qualifying Projects.

Satisfactory Progress (SP)

In project work (IQP, MQP only) extending beyond one term for which a grade is not yet assigned, an interim
grade of SP (Satisfactory Progress) may be used on grade sheets. In such cases, the SP evaluation will count as
units earned toward meeting the 15-unit rule, the distribution requirements, and the minimum standards for
satisfactory academic progress. SP grades remain on the transcript until changed to the <nal grade as submitted
on the Completion of Degree Requirement Form or through the grade change form procedure.

Other Grades

A ? or Q signi<es a grade that has not been submitted.


Qualifying Project Grading
The Faculty of WPI has endorsed the following grading guidelines for qualifying project activity:

 1. Each term a student is registered for a qualifying project, the student receives a term grade re=ecting
    assessment of his or her accomplishments for that term.
 2. Upon completion of a project, each student will receive an overall project grade (also known as the “CDR
    grade,” since it certi<es completion of the degree requirement) re=ecting his or her individual overall
    accomplishments for the project.
 3. The term grades and the overall project grade re=ect both the products of the project (e.g., results, reports,
    etc.) and also the process by which they were attained. The term grades and the overall project grade may
    be di9erent.


The following are some characteristics that faculty should use in communicating expectations and
evaluating the quality of each student’s project work.

The degree to which the student:

     •   developed e9ective or creative goals or approaches,
     •   demonstrated initiative and originality,
     •   showed depth and critical thought in analysis,
     •   produced high quality results,
     •   took the lead in discussion, planning, and analysis,
     •   produced a clear, professional-level report with excellent drafts along the way,
     •   anticipated work that needed to be done and completed it in a timely manner, and
     •   worked to advance the success of the team.


For both terms and overall project, the available grades and interpretations are:

A: This grade denotes excellent work that attains all of the project goals and learning outcomes. The product and
process of this work meet all of the expectations and exceed them in several areas.

B: This grade denotes consistently good work that attains the project goals and learning outcomes. The product
and process of this work meet but generally do not exceed all of the expectations.

C: This grade denotes acceptable work that partially attains project goals and learning outcomes. The product
and process of this work meet some but not all expectations.

SP: This grade denotes satisfactory progress and certi<es su:cient accomplishments to earn credit for that term.
Faculty who assign this grade should provide clear feedback to the student regarding his or her progress during
the term. The use of the SP grade is discouraged except in circumstances where the faculty member is unable




27                                                                                          WPI 2023-24 Catalog
to judge the quality of the work, yet can attest that the granting of credit is appropriate. This is a temporary
grade and must be replaced by a permanent grade consistent with the criteria outlined above by, if not before,
the end of the project.

NR: This grade denotes work that did not attain the project goals or learning outcomes and is insu2cient for
registered credit. Both product and process were inconsistent with acceptable project work at WPI as outlined
above.

NAC: This grade is reserved for performance that is unacceptable. It might mean that a student’s performance (or
lack of it) has seriously impeded group progress, or it has embarrassed the group, a project sponsor, or WPI.
Note that this grade remains on the transcript.

4. Project goals should be established and clearly articulated early in the project. This may be done in the form
of a formal project proposal. Learning outcomes for the qualifying projects have been established by the faculty
and are published in the undergraduate catalog.

5. Project advisors should clearly convey in writing their expectations for learning and performance to project
students at the start of the project, and provide students with substantive feedback on a regular basis during the
project.


Cumulative Grade Point Average
WPI does not maintain a Cumulative Grade Point Average for undergraduate students. A student who needs a
cumulative point average for external use may apply to the Registrar and receive a numerical equivalent. This
information is usually provided only for students applying to graduate or professional schools when the
application process requires a translation. Cumulative point averages will not be printed on student’s transcripts
nor shall class rankings be developed from them.

When requested by the student, the numerical equivalent of the cumulative point average will be based on a
point assignment of A = 4.0, B = 3.0, C = 2.0 while DIST and AC grades will be 4.0 and 2.75 respectively.


Dean’s List
The Dean’s List is created and published twice a year: in January to review student work completed during the
AB terms and in May to review student work completed during the CD terms. To be named to the Dean’s List a
student must:

Complete 4/3 units with grades of A’s, and at least an additional 2/3 units with grades of B or above.

For example, a student with 4A’s, 2B’s and 1C (or 1 NR) in 1/3-unit courses during a semester is eligible for the
Dean’s List. Credits earned in Wellness and Physical Education, Military Science, and Air Force Aerospace
Studies are not used in the evaluation for the Dean’s List. For the purposes of determining the Dean’s List only, an
SP grade for project work will be considered a B grade. The Dean’s List recognizes outstanding work completed
during the most recent semester. Student requests to re-evaluate their eligibility for the Dean’s List due to a
grade change after the semester review is completed will be considered only in unusual circumstances and at
the discretion of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies.


Grade Appeal and Grade Change Policy
The purpose of the Grade Appeal Policy is to provide the student with a safeguard against receiving an unfair
<nal grade, while respecting the academic responsibility of the instructor. Thus, this procedure recognizes that,

  • Every student has a right to receive a grade assigned upon a fair and unprejudiced evaluation based on a
    method that is neither arbitrary nor capricious; and,
  • Instructors have the right to assign a grade based on any method that is professionally acceptable,
    submitted in writing to all students, and applied equally.




28                                                                                           WPI 2023-24 Catalog
Instructors have the responsibility to provide careful evaluation and timely assignment of appropriate grades.
Course and project grading methods should be explained to students at the beginning of the term. WPI
presumes that the judgment of the instructor of record is authoritative, and the <nal grades assigned are
correct.

A grade appeal shall be con<ned to charges of unfair action toward an individual student and may not involve a
challenge of an instructor’s grading standard. A student has a right to expect thoughtful and clearly de<ned
approaches to course and project grading, but it must be recognized that varied standards and individual
approaches to grading are valid. The grade appeal considers whether a grade was determined in a fair and
appropriate manner; it does not attempt to grade or re-grade individual assignments or projects. It is incumbent
on the student to substantiate the claim that his or her <nal grade represents unfair treatment, compared to the
standard applied to other students. Only the <nal grade in a course or project may be appealed. In the absence
of compelling reasons, such as clerical error, prejudice, or capriciousness, the grade assigned by the instructor
of record is to be considered <nal.

In a grade appeal, only arbitrariness, prejudice, and/or error will be considered as legitimate grounds for an
appeal.

Arbitrariness: The grade awarded represents such a substantial departure from accepted academic norms as to
demonstrate that the instructor did not actually exercise professional judgment.

Prejudice: The grade awarded was motivated by ill will, and is not indicative of the student’s academic
performance.

Error: The instructor made a mistake in fact.

This grade appeal procedure applies only when a student initiates a grade appeal and not when the instructor
decides to change a grade on his or her own initiative. This procedure does not cover instances where students
have been assigned grades based on academic dishonesty or academic misconduct, which are included in
WPI’s Academic Honesty Policy. Also excluded from this procedure are grade appeals alleging discrimination,
harassment or retaliation in violation of WPI’s Sexual Harass- ment Policy, which shall be referred to the
appropriate o:ce at WPI as required by law and by WPI policy.

The Grade Appeal Procedure strives to resolve a disagreement between student and instructor concerning the
assignment of a grade in an expeditious and collegial manner. The intent is to provide a mechanism for the
informal discussion of di9erences of opinion, and for the formal adjudication by faculty only when necessary. In
all instances, students who believe that an appropriate grade has not been assigned must <rst seek to resolve
the matter informally with the instructor of record. If the matter cannot be resolved informally, the student must
present his or her case to the Faculty Review Committee before the end of the second week of the term after
the disputed grade is received (D term grades may be appealed the following A term). Any exceptions to this
deadline for submission of appeal can only be made by the O:ce of the Provost.


Student Grade Appeal Procedure
 1. A student who wishes to question a grade must discuss the matter <rst with the instructor of record within
    one week after the start of the next regular academic term (A – D) after receiving the grade. Late appeals
    will only be reviewed at the discretion of the Faculty Review Committee (FRC). In most cases, the
    discussion between the student and the instructor should su:ce and the matter will not need to be carried
    further. The student should be aware that the only valid basis for grade appeal beyond Step One is to
    establish that an instructor assigned a grade that was arbitrary, prejudiced, or in error.
 2. If the student’s concerns remain unresolved after the discussion with the instructor, the student may submit
    a written request to meet with the appropriate Department Head, within one week of speaking with the
    instructor. For a grade in a course, independent study, Inquiry Seminar or Practicum, or Major Qualifying
    Project (MQP), the appropriate person is the instructor’s Department Head. For a grade in an Interactive
    Qualifying Project (IQP), the appropriate person is the Dean of the Department of Integrated and Global
    Studies (DIGS). If the instructor of record is a Department Head or the Dean of the DIGS, then the student
    should request to meet with the representative from the Provost’s o:ce (the Dean of Undergraduate
    Studies, or alternative if necessary), who will serve as the appropriate Department Head/Dean in this step.
    The appropriate Department Head/Dean will meet within one week with the student, and, if he or she
    believes that the complaint may have merit, with the instructor. After consultation with the Department


29                                                                                           WPI 2023-24 Catalog
      Head/Dean, the instructor may choose to let the grade remain, to change a course grade, or to petition the
      Committee on Academic Operations to change a grade for a Degree Requirement (CDR grade for MQP,
      IQP, or Humanities and Arts Inquiry Seminar or Practicum). The Department Head/Dean will communicate
      the result of these discussions to the student.
 3.   If the matter remains unresolved after Step Two, the student should submit a written request within one
      week to the Provost’s O:ce to request an ad hoc Faculty Committee for Appeal of a Grade. The Provost’s
      representative (the Dean of Undergraduate Studies, or alternate) will meet with the student, and will ask
      the FRC to appoint the ad hoc Committee for Appeal of a Grade. The Chair of the FRC will select the
      members of the ad hoc committee and serve as its non-voting chair. The ad hoc committee for all
      undergraduate appeals will be composed of three FRC members. Appointees to the ad hoc committee
      must not have any apparent con=icts of interest with the student or instructor of record. The Chair of the
      FRC requests a written statement from the student and a written response from the instructor. The ad hoc
      committee examines the written information and may gather additional information as it sees <t.
 4.   Through its inquiries and deliberations, the ad hoc committee is charged to determine whether the grade
      was assigned in a fair and appropriate manner, or whether clear and convincing evidence of arbitrariness,
      prejudice, and/or error might justify changing the grade. The ad hoc committee will make its decisions
      based on a majority vote.
 5.   If the ad hoc committee concludes that the grade was assigned in a fair and appropriate manner, the ad
      hoc committee will report its conclusion in writing to the student and instructor. This decision of the ad hoc
      committee is <nal and not subject to appeal.
 6.   If the ad hoc faculty committee determines that compelling reasons exist for changing the grade, it would
      request that the instructor make the change, providing the instructor with a written explanation of its
      reasons. At this point, the instructor may change the grade. If the instructor declines to change the grade,
      he or she must provide a written explanation for refusing. If the ad hoc faculty committee concludes that
      the instructor’s written explanation justi<es the original grade, the ad hoc committee will report this in
      writing to the student and instructor and the matter will be closed. If the ad hoc faculty committee
      concludes that it would be unjust to allow the original grade to stand, the ad hoc committee will then
      determine what grade is to be assigned. The new grade may be higher than, the same as, or lower than the
      original grade. Having made this determination, the three members of the committee will sign the grade
      change form and transmit it to the Registrar. The instructor and student will be advised of the new grade.
      Under no circumstances may persons other than the original faculty member or the review committee
      change a grade. The written records of these proceedings will be <led in the student’s <le in the Registrar’s
      O:ce.


Faculty Grade Change Procedure
The Student Grade Appeal Procedure a:rms the principle that grades should be considered <nal. The principle
that grades for courses or projects should be considered <nal does not excuse an instructor from the
responsibility to explain his or her grading standards to students and to assign grades in a fair and appropriate
manner. The appeal procedure also provides an instructor with the opportunity to change a grade for a course
or project on his or her own initiative. The appeal procedure recognizes that errors can be made and that an
instructor who decides that it would be unfair to allow a <nal grade to stand due to error, prejudice or
arbitrariness may request a change of grade for a course or project without the formation of an ad hoc
committee. An instructor may request a grade change in one of two ways. First, for courses, an instructor may
submit a course grade change via Workday to the Registrar at any time prior to a student’s graduation. Second,
for Degree Requirements (MQP, IQP), an instructor must submit a petition to the Committee on Academic
Operations (CAO) to change the grade.



Transfer Credits
Transferring Credit Before Matriculation to WPI
The O:ce of Admissions transfer admissions team coordinates the formal evaluation of credit with evaluators in
each academic department for a WPI degree for coursework taken prior to matriculation. For incoming <rst year
students, this process starts after the May 1st enrollment deadline for the upcoming fall semester. For transfer
students, this starts after admission to the university. More information is available
at www.wpi.edu/+transfercredit. Each WPI academic department has their own policy regarding transfer
credit and designates a faculty evaluator to review coursework submitted. Courses taken at regionally



30                                                                                            WPI 2023-24 Catalog
accredited post-secondary institutions that are comparable to courses o9ered at WPI will be reviewed for
course content and level by the WPI academic department o9ering the comparable course. In general, only
those courses in which the student received a grade of C or better will be evaluated for possible transfer credit,
with some department requiring a grade of B or better. Please note vocational, correspondence, pre-college or
review courses are not transferable. Also, noncredit CEU courses, adult enrichment or refresher courses, and
CLEP examinations are not recognized for transfer credit.


Transferring Credit A6er Matriculation to WPI
If you are currently a WPI student who wishes to take courses at a regionally accredited post-secondary
institution, you must obtain a WPI Transfer Credit Authorization form from the Registrar’s O:ce. This form and
the course description must be taken to the WPI department head or transfer faculty approved by the
department head for approval before the course is taken. On the form, the department head speci<es a
minimum grade for transfer. This minimum grade depends on the institution at which the course is taken and
how critical the course is to the department. Please note, most departments do not accept on-line courses for
transfer credit. Con<rm this with the relevant department before registering and completing any on-line courses.
Courses that have not been pre-approved may not receive transfer credit. The completed form must be <led in
the Registrar’s O:ce before taking the course. After successful completion of the course, an o:cial transcript
should be sent to WPI. Students can check the web for posting of credit. Please note vocational,
correspondence, pre-college or review courses are not transferable. Also, noncredit CEU courses, adult
enrichment or refresher courses, and CLEP examinations are not recognized for transfer credit.


Transferring Consortium Courses
Courses taken through the consortium do not need to be transferred into WPI. Courses will automatically be
part of the WPI transcript. However, if you are taking the course through the consortium to ful<ll a WPI
distribution requirement, you should check with the Registrar’s O:ce to see if the course has been pre-
approved to satisfy the requirement. If not, you will need approval from the relevant department head before
taking the course.

To apply for approval of a consortium course to satisfy a speci<c WPI distribution requirement, a student must
obtain a WPI Transfer Credit Authorization form from the Registrar’s O:ce. This form and the course description
must be taken to the WPI department head for approval before the course is taken. The WPI department head
decides whether the proposed course meets the department distribution requirement. If it does, the
department head speci<es on the form a minimum grade for satisfying the distribution requirement. This
minimum grade depends on the institution at which the course is taken and how critical the course is within the
department. Courses that have not been pre-approved may receive WPI elective credit. The complete form
must be <led in the Registrar’s O:ce before taking the course.


Advanced Placement
WPI awards credit to students who score a “4” or “5” on most Advanced Placement Examinations. The O:ce of
Academic Advising will notify such students of their earned credit by mail to the home address during early
August. You can visit the Registrar’s O:ce web site www.wpi.edu/o:ces/registrar/policies-procedures/ap-
credit for a complete list of AP credits for exams taken.

Humanities
The Humanities and Arts Department will accept a maximum of 1/3 unit of AP credit towards the Humanities
and Arts requirement. AP credit beyond one course (1/3 unit) in the Humanities and Arts may be counted toward
other requirements such as free elective credit or particular majors and minors at WPI. For most humanities
disciplines, students who score a 4 or 5 in the AP test will receive credit in the relevant discipline. Special cases
in language and studio art are explained below.

AP credit in languages
Students who score a 4 or higher on the College Board AP exam in Chinese language and culture, German
Language, Spanish language, or Spanish literature, automatically receive 1/3 unit of credit in the language. This




31                                                                                            WPI 2023-24 Catalog
can be applied to the breadth component of the HUA Requirement or to the HUA language track option. In
either case, the student will receive credit for one of the following Elementary 1000-level language courses and
cannot enroll in that course for additional credit: CN 1541, GN 1511, SP 1523.

Students who took Arabic, Chinese, German, or Spanish in high school – but who do not earn AP credit for it at
WPI – can get 1/3 unit retroactive credit for that language if they meet the following 3 criteria: 1) studied it for
three or more years in high school and maintained at least a B average for all three years and; 2) place into at
least the 2nd term of the appropriate WPI language sequence; and 3) successfully complete two terms of that
language at WPI, earning grades of B or higher in both courses. The exception is Spanish: students studying
Spanish must complete Intermediate I (SP 2521) and Intermediate II (SP 2522) with a grade B or higher. To request
1/3 unit retroactive language credit, please use the appropriate form on the Humanities and Arts website
(https://www.wpi.edu/academics/departments/humanities-arts/resources). Students may receive credit for
either the AP exam or 3 years of high school language study, but not both. For questions about this policy,
please contact the Humanities and Arts Department.

AP Credit in Studio Art
Students who score a 4 or 5 in the AP test in studio art are eligible for HUA credit after a successful portfolio
review by art faculty.

Computer Science
Advanced placement in computer science can be earned for the “Computer Science AP A” exam. Credit for CS
1000 is granted for scoring a “4” or “5” on the CS AP A exam. No credit will be granted for “Computer Science AP
Principles” exam.

The Computer Science department advises CS Majors who earn a “4” or a “5” on the CS AP A exam to enroll in
CS 1102 (Accelerated Introduction to Program Design). Students who wish to pursue a CS Minor after earning a
“4” or a “5” on the CS AP A exam may consider enrolling in CS 2119 (Application Building with Object-Oriented
Concepts) or CS 2301 (Systems Programming for Non-Majors).

Students who took CS AP Principles exam and have substantial programming experience should consult with
the CS course instructors as to which course to take.

Natural Sciences
Students who pass the advanced placement test in Biology or Physics B with a “4 or 5” will be awarded 1/3 unit
of advanced placement credit. This credit will show on the transcript as “L”. For students who score “4 or 5” in
Physics C (Mechanics) will be awarded 1/3 unit in Physics 1110/ 1111. Students who score “4 or 5” in Physics C
(Electricity and Magnetism) will be awarded 1/3 advanced placement credit for Physics 1120/1121. For those
students who pass Physics B will be awarded 1/3 unit in Physics 1000. Students who score 4/5 on the Chemistry
Advanced Placement Examination or 6/7 on the Chemistry International Baccalaureate Exam are automatically
awarded 1/3 unit of credit for CH 1010.

Mathematics
Students who pass the AB mathematics examination with a “4” or “5” will be awarded 2/3 unit of advanced
placement credit for MA 1021 and MA 1022. Students with a “4” or “5” on the advanced placement BC exam will
be awarded 1 unit advanced placement credit for MA 1021, MA 1022 and MA 1023. Retroactive AP credit is only
possible for MA 1021 and/or MA 1022 via the following pathways. In the four-course 1021-1024 mathematics
sequence, students who arrive at WPI prepared to start with the second (or third) course in the WPI sequence,
and who successfully pass that course and the one that follows it, will be considered to have established
advanced placement credit for the <rst one (or two) courses. Retroactive AP credit is awarded for MA 1021 and
MA 1022 if a student arrives at WPI prepared to take MA 1024 and successfully passes that course and MA
2051. To qualify for retroactive credit, the two WPI courses must be passed on the <rst attempt by D-term of the
student’s <rst year and the student must have no grades of NR in any course in the MA 1021-1024 sequence in
the <rst year. The courses credited retroactively will be listed by number without an assigned grade and will
count toward the distribution requirement in mathematics.

Project Lead The Way (PLTW)
WPI awards credit to current WPI students who completed a PLTW Engineering course in high school, received
a minimum of a “B” in the course, and earned on the PLTW End-of-Course Assessment either a stanine score of
6 or higher (before July 2018) or a minimum scale score of 410 for IED, 410 for POE, 420 for CEA, 430 for CIM, 450
for DE. WPI also honors PLTW transfer credits from other select PLTW university partners, such as RIT. Please
visit the WPI Project Lead The Way web site (www.wpi.edu/+pltw) for more information and to apply for credit. A
sta9 member will notify students of their earned credit..



Academic Honesty Policy
Academic honesty is a fundamental principle of learning and a necessary foundation for all academic
institutions, particularly those dedicated to independent project-based education, such as WPI. Violations of the
principle deny the violators an opportunity to obtain con<dent command of the material they are credited with
knowing, cheat their classmates out of deserved rewards and recognition, debase the institution, and demean
the degree that it awards. It is, therefore, a matter of great and mutual concern to all members of the WPI
community that a concerted e9ort be made to maintain high standards of integrity, both to protect the value of
the educational process in which we are engaged and to maintain the credibility of the institution.


Definition
Individual integrity is vital to the academic environment because education involves the search for and
acquisition of knowledge and understanding, which are, in themselves, intangible. Evaluation of each student’s
level of knowledge and understanding is a vital part of the teaching process, and requires tangible measures
such as reports, examinations, and homework. Any act that interferes with the process of evaluation by
misrepresentation of the relation between the work being evaluated (or the resulting evaluation) and the
student’s actual state of knowledge is an act of academic dishonesty. The following acts are examples of
academic dishonesty at WPI:


Fabrication
Examples:

     •   Altering grades or other o:cial records
     •   Changing exam solutions after the fact
     •   Inventing or changing laboratory data
     •   Falsifying research
     •   Inventing sources
     •   Sabotage of another student’s work or academic record

Plagiarism

Examples:

     • Misrepresenting the work of another as one’s own
     • Inaccurately or inadequately citing sources including those from the Internet

Cheating

Examples:

     •   Use of purchased term papers
     •   Copying on exams, homework, or take-home exams
     •   Use of unauthorized materials or sources of information such as "cheat sheet," pre-programmed calculator
     •   Assistance of another person in cases where prohibited

Facilitation

Examples:


33                                                                                          WPI 2023-24 Catalog
     •   Sharing test questions or answers from an exam with another student
     •   Letting another student copy a solution to a homework problem, exam, or lab
     •   Taking an exam for another student
     •   Assistance in any act of academic dishonesty of another student


Responsibilities of Faculty Members
and Students
Faculty members should outline their policies concerning evaluation procedures and their expectations
pertaining to academic integrity at the beginning of each course. Faculty must ensure that student performance
is judged solely on the basis of academic work in courses and projects. Because of the di9erences in disciplines
and the type of work involved, faculty interpretation regarding what constitutes academic dishonesty may vary
across campus. Since project-based education places a strong emphasis on group work, faculty and students
should be particularly attentive to the distinction between group work and individual performance expectations.
Faculty and students are responsible for knowing and understanding WPI’s policy and procedure for dealing
with academic dishonesty. Faculty are encouraged to implement measures designed to minimize or prevent
academic dishonesty.


Procedures
The WPI faculty and administration have developed a set of procedures designed to ensure uniform (and fair)
treatment of undergraduate or graduate students suspected of academic dishonesty. Students or others who
suspect a faculty member of professional dishonesty should consult the academic department head or the
provost.

     • Faculty shall report to the department chair any suspected act of academic dishonesty.
     • The chair shall review cases referred to him/her to determine if there is reason for believing that academic
       dishonesty may be involved.
     • Faculty shall allow the student to continue in the course without prejudice, pending resolution of the case.
     • The chair or instructor shall check with the dean or associate dean of students to determine if the student
       has any record of prior o9enses involving academic dishonesty.
     • The chair or instructor shall consult with the student involved. If the act of academic dishonesty is admitted
       and is the <rst violation of that nature, the chair or instructor may resolve the complaint within the
       department, provided the penalty is accepted by the student in writing. The maximum penalty that can be
       applied at the department level is dismissal from a course or a project without credit. In all cases, a signed,
       written report on the matter, including the action taken, shall be sent to the Dean of Students O:ce and to
       the student’s Academic Advisor.
     • For the second and subsequent violations, the case shall be submitted to the Campus Hearing Board for
       resolution.
     • The Campus Hearing Board shall hear the allegations, following standard procedures for disciplinary
       hearings established by WPI. The board may impose normal disciplinary sanctions and may recommend
       loss of any credit or grade for the course or project. If a student is found not responsible on a complaint of
       academic dishonesty, he/she may not be failed or penalized by the instructor on the grounds of
       dishonesty. The instructor shall assign a grade based on his or her assessment of the student’s mastery of
       the material being evaluated.
     • Disciplinary records for any act of academic dishonesty shall be retained in the Dean of Students O:ce for
       two years from the date of graduation or withdrawal from WPI, except when the sanction includes
       suspension or expulsion. In cases resulting in suspension or expulsion from WPI, disciplinary records shall
       be kept in perpetuity. Records for cases that are pending completion of the hearing and/or the sanction
       shall be kept in perpetuity. Judicial records are kept separate from a student’s academic records. A
       student’s judicial record may be shared internally as appropriate to determine if a past record exists.
       Records shall be available to prospective employers and other authorized individuals, in accordance with
       federal regulations that require written permission from the student involved.



Commencement Policy
The policy for allowing certain undergraduate students who have not completed all degree requirements to
participate in Commencement exercises is:


34                                                                                              WPI 2023-24 Catalog
 1. Undergraduate students who have not met all degree requirements will be eligible to participate in
    Commencement exercises only if all of the following are true:
      1. At the end of D term, the student is within 1 unit of completing all requirements for graduation.
      2. The student has completed at least 2 of the 3 WPI Project Requirements (Humanities and Arts
          Requirement, IQP, and MQP).
 2. Undergraduate students who meet these conditions will be permitted to participate in Commencement
    exercises but will not receive their diploma. The names of such students will not be included in the
    Commencement program. The actual degree will be conferred only after all degree requirements have
    been completed. The student will not be eligible to participate in any future commencement ceremonies
    for this degree.

Degree Requirements

WPI Degree Requirements
WPI Degree Requirements
(e9ective for students matriculating after August 1, 2011)

WPI’s academic requirements are speci<cally designed to develop an overall educational experience which
meets the goals of the college. Each requirement plays a supporting role as follows:

     • To provide intellectual breadth and a better understanding of themselves and the diversity and creativity of
       human experience, every WPI student must complete a Humanities and Arts Requirement;
     • To provide an understanding of the priorities of other sectors of society, develop the ability to communicate
       e9ectively with disparate groups, organize and derive solutions to complex problems, and gain an
       awareness of the interrelationships between technology and people, every WPI student must complete an
       Interactive Qualifying Project (IQP);
     • To provide a capstone experience in the professional discipline, to develop creativity, instill self-con<dence
       and enhance the ability to communicate ideas and synthesize fundamental concepts, every student must
       complete a Major Qualifying Project (MQP);
     • To provide for learning through an academic program with fabric and course balance while encouraging
       individual student choices within that framework, every student must ful<ll Distribution Requirements.




41                                                                                             WPI 2023-24 Catalog
WPI Terms and Credit Units
The Bachelor degree from WPI normally is based upon a residency at WPI of 16 terms. WPI operates on a
system with four seven-week terms, two in the autumn semester (Terms A and B) and two in the spring
semester (Terms C and D). A summer session, Term E, is also available. The normal academic load for each term
is de<ned as one unit of work, usually divided among three courses or projects. Thus, the usual credit unit for
courses or independent study/projects is 1/3 unit. Qualifying Projects require one full unit of activity which may
be concentrated into a single term (especially if conducted o9-campus) or spread throughout an academic year.
The degree will be awarded upon completion of the following:

DEGREE REQUIREMENTS:

 1. The Humanities and Arts Requirement Quali<cation by overall evaluation of two units of work in the
    humanities and arts.
      ◦ To provide intellectual breadth and a better understanding of themselves and the diversity and
        creativity of human experience, every WPI student must complete a Humanities and Arts
        Requirement.
 2. The Mathematics and Science Requirement (See distribution requirements for individual programs)
      ◦ The Mathematics and Science Requirement de<nes a minimum standard of scienti<c, technological,
        engineering, and mathematical literacy for graduates of WPI, regardless of major <eld. Most degree
        programs will provide a substantial level of preparation in most of these areas, far beyond this
        standard. Students will satisfy this requirement by satisfying the program requirements of their
        individual major programs.
      ◦ The goals of the Mathematics and Science Requirement at WPI are that students will be able, in their
        careers and daily lives, to: 1) explain and apply key concepts and principles of scienti<c disciplines and
        use an understanding of scienti<c methods to make critical judgments, 2) apply mathematical
        methods to understand the solution of real-world problems, 3) productively and appropriately use
        computers and other technology, 4) use methods from the quantitative, natural or engineering
        sciences to systematically identify, formulate, and solve problems.
      ◦ The speci<c requirement is two units of work in science, engineering, mathematical science or
        computer science. Two-thirds units of work must be in Quantitative Science; two-thirds units of work
        must be in Natural or Engineering Science; the <nal two-thirds unit may be from any of the
        Quantitative, Natural, or Engineering Sciences. Each major program may decide which courses and/or
        pre<xes count for each category. Each major program may set more restrictive requirements as the
        program sees <t.

 3. The Interactive Qualifying Project
      ◦ Successful completion of a qualifying project relating science and/or technology to society (the
         Interactive Qualifying Project, or IQP) representing at least one unit of credit in project or independent
         study work. The format of the documentation is to be in accordance with current WPI policy on such
         documentation.
 4. The Major Qualifying Project
      ◦ Successful completion of a qualifying project in the major area of study (the Major Qualifying Project,
         or MQP) representing at least one unit of credit in project or independent study work. The format of
         the documentation is to be in accordance with current WPI policy on such documentation.
 5. Distribution Requirements (See program description for speci<ed departments)
      ◦ Satisfaction of published academic activity distribution requirements in or relating to the major area of
         study. These requirements typically total no more than ten units (including the MQP and two units to
         ful<ll the Mathematics and Science Requirement) and are speci<ed by general topical subject area,
         not by speci<c courses. Completion of distribution requirements will be certi<ed by the appropriate
         Program Review Committee (PRC), upon recommendation by the student’s academic advisor. For
         students desiring designation of a major area for which a determination regarding distribution
         requirements has not previously been made and published, a faculty committee will be appointed by
         the department head or DIGS dean to review and approve the student’s program of study.
 6. Social Sciences
      ◦ Completion of 2/3 unit of work in the social sciences, exclusive of qualifying project.
 7. Residency Requirement
      ◦ A minimum of eight units must be completed satisfactorily in residence at WPI. (It is anticipated the
         normal residence at WPI will be 16 terms.)
 8. Minimum Academic Credit


42                                                                                           WPI 2023-24 Catalog
     ◦ The minimum academic credit required for the Bachelor degree is 15 units. Credit accumulated
        beyond the published distribution requirements shall be accomplished by the addition of “free
        elective” work.
 9. Wellness and Physical Education
     ◦ Quali<cation in wellness and physical education shall be established by completing 1/3 unit of course
        work (four WPE classes) or its equivalent. Such an equivalent, for example, may be participation in
        club or varsity sports.



Degree Options
Concentrations
De7nition

A Concentration is an option associated with a major which provides recognition for focused and coordinated
academic work either within the major or within an area of study closely related to the major.

Rules

 1. All Concentrations require completion of two units of integrated academic study plus an MQP with a topic
    and content appropriate to the given Concentration.
 2. Concentrations deemed to belong exclusively or primarily within the stated major must be accommodated
    within the distribution requirements of that major.
 3. Concentrations deemed to have a substantial interdisciplinary nature can exceed the normal 10-unit
    allotment of the major by as much as 1 unit, provided that the additional requirements do not include or
    permit academic work designated by the major pre<x or coursework normally taken to satisfy the major’s
    portion of the distribution requirements. Furthermore, Concentrations of an interdisciplinary nature are
    permitted to use up to 1 unit of the academic program beyond the distribution requirements of the major,
    including the IQP, Social Science requirement, and Free Electives, as deemed appropriate.
 4. The requirements of the Concentration must be designed to o9er choices for the student within the major
    area and, if relevant, outside the distribution requirements of the major; however, the Concentration
    requirements must not preclude meeting the normal distribution requirements for the major.
 5. Rules and guidelines for each Concentration will be formulated by the faculty associated with the
    governing major, and must be reviewed by the Committee on Academic Operations (CAO) and
    subsequently approved by the Faculty. CAO is empowered to rule on whether a proposed Concentration is
    disciplinary or interdisciplinary.
 6. An individual program of study leading to a major with a Concentration will be planned by a student in
    consultation with his/her academic advisor. The student’s intention to pursue a Concentration will be
    declared by application to the appropriate Program Review Committee in accordance with that
    Committee’s schedule of deadlines. Application deadlines should be designed to enable Committee
    review and communication of decisions to students at a su:ciently early point that =exibility of schedule
    still exists. Extenuating circumstances may be considered at the discretion of the Program Review
    Committee.
 7. Concentrations and minors are additional degree designations. Any credit earned for an additional degree
    designation must not overlap with credit earned for another additional degree designation by more
    than one unit. Also, no credit-bearing activity may be triple-counted towards degree designations or
    degree requirements.


Minors
De7nition

A minor is a thematically-related set of academic activities leading to a degree designation in addition to but
separate from that granted by the major. A minor should be available to students of any major, with the
exception of a minor which overlaps with a major area to such an extent that it is not su:ciently distinct from
that major. The Committee on Academic Operations (CAO) is responsible for the review of proposed minor
programs and decisions regarding allowed major/minor combinations.

Rules


43                                                                                           WPI 2023-24 Catalog
 1. A minor requires completion of two or more units of thematically related activity. Individual departments
    may impose additional restrictions such as a capstone or integrative experience. Students should consult
    individual minor Program descriptions in Section 2 of this catalog for these restrictions.
 2. It is expected that minor requirements will be structured so that all acceptable major/minor combinations
    can be accommodated within a normal 16 term framework.
 3. A minor may include any portion of the academic program, excluding the MQP. Academic activities used in
    satisfying the regular degree requirements may be double-counted toward meeting all but one unit of the
    minor requirements, subject to the following restrictions:
       1. The one unit of double-counted work may include at most 1/3 unit of the IQP, 3/3 units of the
           Humanities and Arts Requirement, or a combination thereof.
       2. At least one unit of the minor must be free elective choices.
 4. The Program Review Committee for a minor area will consist of faculty members designated by the
    sponsoring faculty members.
 5. A minor area must be proposed by a sponsoring group of faculty and must be de<ned by the purpose of
    achieving an educational goal beyond those apparent or implicit in the regular degree requirements.
    Student- initiated minor programs must be developed with the approval of a sponsoring group of faculty
    advisors. Each minor program must be reviewed by CAO for its individual merit.
 6. Minors are additional degree designations. Any credit earned for an additional degree designation must
    not overlap with credit earned for another additional degree designation by more than one unit. Also,
    no credit-bearing activity may be triple-counted towards degree designations or degree requirements.

Minors are described in the “Program Description” section of this catalog. Minors sponsored by a department are
described following the department. Others are listed in the “Interdisciplinary Minors” section. Follow this link to
the current list of approved minors:

WPI Minors Listing

Interdisciplinary or Individually Designed (ID) minors are approved by the Committee on Academic Operations
(CAO).

The form needed to declare a minor or to propose an interdisciplinary or individually designed minor can be
found under Curriculum Adjustments on the Registrar’s O:ce website.


Double Majors
An option for some students who wish to broaden their WPI experience is the completion of two distinct majors
through the double major option. The choice to pursue a double major should be made early in a student’s
career. No student shall complete more than two undergraduate majors.

A double major should signify capacity in two distinct disciplines. Some combinations of double majors are not
su:ciently distinct to merit this designation. Departments and programs decide whether any combinations of
double majors overlap to such an extent as to be disallowed. As of the publication date of this catalog, the
following combinations are not allowed:

     • Actuarial Mathematics and Mathematical Sciences
     • Aerospace Engineering and Mechanical Engineering
     • Biochemistry and Chemistry
     • Business and Management Engineering
     • Business and Management Information Systems
     • Civil Engineering and Architectural Engineering
     • Civil Engineering and Environmental Engineering
     • Industrial Engineering and Management Engineering with Concentration in Industrial Engineering
     • Interactive Media and Game Development Technology and Interactive Media and Game Development
     • Management Information Systems and Management Engineering with Concentration in Information
       Technology
     • Physics and Applied Physics




44                                                                                           WPI 2023-24 Catalog
Students who wish to pursue any double major should consult with faculty advisors in both majors. Exceptions
to disallowed double majors must be approved by the Committee on Academic Operations.

Degree requirements for double majors are as follows

 1. Distribution Requirements. The distribution requirements of each major must be met, but requirements
    common to both majors have to be met only once.
 2. The Humanities and Arts Requirement. No modi<cations are made to the Humanities and Arts
    Requirement for double majors. All students, including majors in Humanities and Arts or International and
    Global Studies must satisfactorily complete the Humanities and Arts Requirement culminating in an Inquiry
    Seminar or Practicum
 3. The Interactive Qualifying Project. If one of the majors of a double major is in Social Science and Policy
    Studies, a single project bearing at least one unit credit may be used to satisfy both the MQP requirement
    for the SSPS major and the IQP requirement. In order to be used to satisfy both requirements, the
    combined social science MQP and IQP must meet the goals of both projects. It must be interactive in
    nature involving an aspect of technology, and must also be an application of social science knowledge and
    analytical techniques. In order to select a single project that satis<es both the goals of the MQP and the
    goals of the IQP, the decision to pursue a social science double major needs to be made fairly early in the
    student’s career.
 4. The Major Qualifying Project. The MQP requirements for Double Majors may be ful<lled in either one of
    two ways:
      1. Option 1: Two distinct projects, one in each major, each of at least one unit of credit.
      2. Option 2: One interdisciplinary project of at least 4/3 units of credit, and having signi<cant work
          associated with each major. An interdisciplinary project must be:
       ◦ jointly advised by at least two faculty members, one associated with each of the relevant degree
          programs; OR
       ◦ advised by a single faculty member who is associated with both of the relevant degree programs.

Faculty associated with each degree program are listed on the departmental page. Please follow this link for a
directory of WPI Faculty.

An interdisciplinary MQP involving social science may not be used as an IQP.

The interdisciplinary MQP option takes advantage of the value of interdisciplinary work at the intersection of the
two majors. Students undertaking an interdisciplinary MQP must complete an interdisciplinary MQP approval
form in advance of project registration, and this form must be signed by all advisor(s) on the project. This form
must contain a summary of the proposed project work indicating the content relating to each major. The
interdisciplinary MQP option is available only at the discretion of the faculty and only when all faculty advisor(s)
agree on the project content. Students planning to use this option should identify and consult with their faculty
advisor(s) well before the end of their junior year.

For a double major, completion of a 4/3 unit interdisciplinary MQP completes the 1 unit MQP requirement for
each major. The assignment of credit is as follows: 2/3 unit is double counted toward each major, and the
remaining 2/3 unit is allocated as 1/3 unit to one major and 1/3 unit to the other major.

Note: It is anticipated that in some cases a student pursuing a double major will join a project team whose other
members are pursuing a single major. The double-majoring student will bring the interdisciplinary content to the
project, and this additional work will be represented by the additional credit that that student (perhaps only that
student) earns, and with an enlarged report prepared by that student.

For students wishing to pursue double majors, the program audit for each intended major must be completed
and certi<ed by the review committee of each department involved. Academic activities appropriate to both
majors may be counted in both majors. For the policy in the special situation of double majors involving the
social sciences see the Social Science and Policy Studies department description in Section 2 and the Double
Major Distribution Requirements in Section 4 of the Undergraduate Catalog.

Certain interdisciplinary MQP’s and corresponding double-majors in the same department are not allowed.

Interdisciplinary MQP’s with two faculty advisors: All faculty advisors have equal status in approving the <nal
project, and a single grade is submitted for each term’s work and a single project grade is submitted on the CDR

form. Should an interdisciplinary MQP, once completed, be deemed acceptable as an MQP for one of the two
majors, but not for the other, and/or if the faculty advisors cannot agree on a single grade after much e9ort to
do so, the project may be considered as the MQP for a single major. This conversion can only occur with the
consent of the student and the advisor(s) from the single major being selected.



Projects and Research
At the heart of the WPI Plan is student research, open-ended inquiry, and original and creative design to solve
problems and to make new discoveries. All students in all majors complete two qualifying projects:

 1. The Major Qualifying Project (MQP),
 2. The Interactive Qualifying Project (IQP).

The Major Qualifying Project requires the synthesis of all previous study as well as the development of new
knowledge to solve problems in the student’s major <eld. The MQP challenges the student to perform at an
advanced level, as a professional would, and to communicate the results e9ectively.

The Interactive Qualifying Project challenges students to address a problem at the intersection of science and
technology with human need.

These projects are substantial and are each equivalent to at least one-fourth of an academic year’s worth of
e9ort. Most IQPs are completed at an o9-campus project center in collaboration with an external sponsor.

Projects must be accepted by a project advisor before project registration can be completed. Many project
opportunities come from o9-campus organizations, address real-world problems and thus provide experience
invaluable for seeking jobs and for professional practice. Students are also encouraged to develop their own
project ideas, to identify and work with interested faculty, and to form teams to pool resources and share points
of view.


Resources - Getting Started
There are many opportunities for students to learn about project opportunities both in the major (for the MQP)
and for the IQP. Advice and links to additional resources can be found on the Undergraduate Studies web page.
.


Available Projects
Students may obtain information about new or ongoing projects from a variety of sources. Principal sources
include discussions with other students, especially those currently involved in a project, the Projects Program
web site, department o:ces, or their web pages. O9-campus projects are discussed annually in the fall. In the
spring, Project Opportunities in eProjects can be used as a directory of speci<c IQP projects or as a source of
ideas for developing your own projects. Some students will <nd a project listed which <ts their needs and
interests exactly. In other cases, the listing will serve to lead students to a faculty member with whom project
involvement can be negotiated. The proposals in eProjects are updated periodically to provide an accurate
listing of available projects.

Students are encouraged to check the web site of the department of their major and Project Opportunities for
MQPs in eProjects (https://eprojects.wpi.edu/), as well as consulting with their academic advisors and with
faculty in their courses. In addition, academic departments hold special events where faculty present project
and other research opportunities to connect with students who are currently doing research.


Project Advisor
Academic advisors can assist students in identifying a project. They are aware of the project interests of many
other faculty members, and have a list of faculty interests which will enable a student to <nd a faculty member
who can help to develop a project idea. Faculty associated with the Department of Integrative & Global
Studies (DIGS) are available to assist students in interdisciplinary and interactive projects.




46                                                                                          WPI 2023-24 Catalog
Project Performance and Time-on-Task
A student is normally expected to expend 15-17 hours per week on the average for each 1/3 unit of credit for
project work, and expected achievement is based upon that commitment.

A project group, whether it involves one student or more, should have a minimum of one scheduled conference
per week with the advisor(s). Additional time should be scheduled when the e9ort exceeds 1/3 unit per student
or when more students are involved.

Students should be prepared to submit interim project reports to the advisor each week. Students are also
encouraged to complete a proposal at the beginning of the project activity to de<ne the scope and timeline for
completion of the e9ort. In addition, oral reports may be required as determined by the advisor. At the end of the
project, a report must be prepared to the satisfaction of the project advisor. For projects sponsored by o9-
campus organizations, both a written and oral report for the sponsors is normally expected.


Qualifying Project Grading
The Faculty of WPI has endorsed the following grading guidelines for qualifying project activity:

 1. Each term a student is registered for a qualifying project, the student receives a term grade re=ecting
    assessment of his or her accomplishments for that term.
 2. Upon completion of a project, each student will receive an overall project grade (also known as the “CDR
    grade,” since it certi<es completion of the degree requirement) re=ecting his or her individual overall
    accomplishments for the project.
 3. The term grades and the overall project grade re=ect both the products of the project (e.g., results, reports,
    etc.) and also the process by which they were attained. The term grades and the overall project grade may
    be di9erent.



The following are some characteristics that faculty should use in communicating expectations
and evaluating the quality of each student’s project work.
The degree to which the student:

     •   developed e9ective or creative goals or approaches,
     •   demonstrated initiative and originality,
     •   showed depth and critical thought in analysis,
     •   produced high quality results,
     •   took the lead in discussion, planning, and analysis,
     •   produced a clear, professional-level report with excellent drafts along the way,
     •   anticipated work that needed to be done and completed it in a timely manner, and
     •   worked to advance the success of the team.



For both terms and overall project, the available grades and interpretations are:
A: This grade denotes excellent work that attains all of the project goals and learning outcomes. The product and
process of this work meet all of the expectations and exceed them in several areas.

B: This grade denotes consistently good work that attains the project goals and learning outcomes. The product
and process of this work meet but generally do not exceed all of the expectations.

C: This grade denotes acceptable work that partially attains project goals and learning outcomes. The product
and process of this work meet some but not all expectations.

SP: This grade denotes satisfactory progress and certi<es su:cient accomplishments to earn credit for that term.
Faculty who assign this grade should provide clear feedback to the student regarding his or her progress during
the term. The use of the SP grade is discouraged except in circumstances where the faculty member is unable




47                                                                                          WPI 2023-24 Catalog
to judge the quality of the work, yet can attest that the granting of credit is appropriate. This is a temporary
grade and must be replaced by a permanent grade consistent with the criteria outlined above by, if not before,
the end of the project.

NR: This grade denotes work that did not attain the project goals or learning outcomes and is insu2cient for
registered credit. Both product and process were inconsistent with acceptable project work at WPI as outlined
above.

NAC: This grade is reserved for performance that is unacceptable. It might mean that a student’s performance (or
lack of it) has seriously impeded group progress, or it has embarrassed the group, a project sponsor, or WPI.
Note that this grade remains on the transcript.

4. Project goals should be established and clearly articulated early in the project. This may be done in the form
of a formal project proposal. Learning outcomes for the qualifying projects have been established by the faculty
and are published in the undergraduate catalog.

5. Project advisors should clearly convey in writing their expectations for learning and performance to project
students at the start of the project, and provide students with substantive feedback on a regular basis during the
project.


Electronic Project Submission
WPI requires that all undergraduate students submit their Interactive Qualifying Project (IQP) and Major
Qualifying Project (MQP) electronically (https://eprojects.wpi.edu/).

Students must be registered for a minimum of 1/6 unit of qualifying project credit in the term in which the <nal
project report is submitted.

No matter which format is used to create the original report document (Microsoft Word, LaTeX or other), the <nal
report must be converted to a PDF format in order to be submitted as an eProject. The <nal PDF is required, and
additional related <les such as simulations, computer programs, multimedia, and data sets may be submitted as
a component of the project. Guidance on eProject report formatting and <le formats for the <nal report and any
supplementary <les is provided within the online submission process, and detailed instructions are available
from an online guide at the Gordon Library: https://libguides.wpi.edu/submitprojects.

The <nal project report should be carefully proofread. Once the submitted project has been approved by the
advisor and released to WPI’s digital repository (Digital WPI) by the Registrar’s O:ce, it is considered an
academic record and cannot be edited.

The deadline for the submission of the initial report draft and the <nal document may be established at the
discretion of the project advisor. Drafts and reports need not be accepted by the advisor after the established
deadline.

A project that is completed by a team of students, except in extenuating circumstances, will submit ONE project
report from the group. After the MQP or IQP team submits the <nal version of the project report, the advisor
must review the work and approve or reject it online at https://eprojects.wpi.edu/.


Group Qualifying Project E5orts
Students meeting a qualifying project degree requirement by participation in a group, or team e9ort, will submit,
at the discretion of the project advisor, either a single, comprehensive written report from the group, or
individual written reports from each member of the group. A single, comprehensive written report must,
however, include some means by which each individual’s contribution to the group e9ort may be clearly
identi<ed. This identi<cation may take the form of an “authorship page,” simply a list of individual chapters and
their respective authors, or of a prefacing statement in which each contributing group member is named as
having carried out one or more speci<c tasks within the overall project e9ort.




48                                                                                          WPI 2023-24 Catalog
In the case where one or more students leave an ongoing group project after having contributed at least one
unit each of project e9ort, those students, again at the discretion of the project advisor, will submit either a
single written report or individual written reports in satisfying the qualifying project documentation requirement.
The same means of identifying individual contributions will be employed as described above.


Dissemination of Project Reports
Completed project reports are made available to the public through Digital WPI, managed by WPI’s Gordon
Library (https://digital.wpi.edu).

MQPs and IQPs completed for o9-campus agencies are usually distributed within the sponsoring agency by the
agency project liaison. A project report may be redacted or restricted from public viewing for a de<ned period of
time, if it contains con<dential or proprietary information of a sponsoring agency.

Students are responsible for keeping personal copies of project reports for their own permanent professional
records. In this way, reports can be reviewed for later use, and incorporated into a professional portfolio.

Thus, MQPs and IQPs are best viewed as research reports which establish good professional practices as well as
being potential sources for further study and research.

Projects
Project Planning
During the academic planning period, which starts in February, students who intend to conduct project work
during the following year should set aside time to plan their projects, meet with faculty, and form project teams.
Any pre-planned projects will be posted on the project opportunities section in e-projects
(https://eprojects.wpi.edu/). Students are also encouraged to meet with faculty individually.

The most important and di2cult part of a project is the planning which precedes the execution. The planning phase
of your project will involve developing a background, talking to people in the <eld, <nding out what has already
been done in the area, and determining what your goals are and what you need to do to accomplish them. If any
special equipment, <nancing, or resources will be needed for execution of the project, it is especially important
to make this known early to ensure that it will be available to you. In addition, most faculty members require a
project proposal before registration of the project.


Project Registration
Students who intend to do project work must complete a project registration form by no later than the
beginning of the <rst term of that project work. Students will complete their registration request through e-
projects after the project is built by the project advisor and the student is added as a member. Instructions for
this process can be found on the Registrar’s website. Any student who will travel to an o9-campus location, such
as a Residential Projects Program site, is also required to <ll out an electronic project registration form.

Project registration for terms A-E will be accepted up to the 10th day of the term (not including weekends)
without penalty. A project involving an o9-campus sponsor (MQP mostly, but some IQP) carries the further
obligation of compliance with the rules and regulations of the sponsor. Often, these are speci<ed in a formal
contract between the sponsor and WPI, and are legally binding. At the time of registration, any a9ected student
will be required to indicate the sponsor on the electronic registration form.




49                                                                                           WPI 2023-24 Catalog
For an MQP, the project advisor or an associate advisor must be a member of the faculty in the discipline which
corresponds to the major area of study of the student.



Change of Registration Information
Students must make all project registration changes through e-projects. Students may make changes to the
project by making an addendum to the previously registered project and submitting the changes electronically
to the project advisor for approval. Credit distribution can be changed for the current term through day 10, or
any future terms. No changes in credit distribution can be made after day 10 of the term.


Changing Project Advisor
To change the project advisor for a degree-required project, students should contact the Registrar’s O:ce.


Project Conferences
Students should report to their project advisor’s o:ce at the beginning of the term to make arrangements for
subsequent meetings.


Overload with Project
Students are strongly encouraged to consult with their project advisor(s) before registering for an overload.
Students are not permitted to overload during a one-term o9-campus project o9ered in the Global Projects
Program or during the prior term when students are enrolled in ID 2050, Social Science Research for the IQP and
an associated pre-qualifying project.


Project Completion
During the <nal term of registration for the project and su:ciently prior to the deadline for submittal of
Completion of Degree Requirement Forms, students must submit their completed project report to the project
advisors. Students are also required to submit a copy of the document to the participating o9-campus
organization su:ciently prior to the end of the term so that proprietary and con<dential information in the report
can be identi<ed and removed. Most o9-campus organizations require 30 days for this review, and the grade and
<nal report cannot be submitted to the Registrar by the project advisor until this review has been done.

Directions for submitting the project report electronically are available from the Gordon Library. A <nal project
report is submitted electronically through the e-projects website (See Electronic Project Submission) The
electronic eCDR must be submitted by the project advisor no later than the 10th day of the next academic term.

A student who has <led an application to receive their degree in May must submit a completed eCDR to the
O:ce of the Registrar by the last Thursday in D-term.


Registration Policy for Degree Requirements
The completion of a degree requirement (MQP, IQP or Humanities and Arts Requirement) will not be recorded in
the Registrar’s O:ce after the tenth day of classes of a term unless the student is registered for a minimum of
1/6 unit of the same activity in that term. The deadline for receipt of the Completion Form is no later than the
tenth day of classes for the next term. Any exceptions to this policy must be handled by written petition from the
project advisor.

Note: Candidates for degrees must meet graduation deadlines if they di9er from the above. Deadlines for
degree candidates will be strictly enforced!

Only Completion of Degree Requirement (CDR) forms which are complete, correct and consistent with the
student’s registration records will be accepted by the Registrar’s O:ce. (See PROJECTS AND RESEARCH section,
page 14.)




50                                                                                          WPI 2023-24 Catalog
O5-Campus Insurance and Legal Agreements
WPI’s insurance program includes a broad range of coverage for students doing projects in cooperation with o9-
campus organizations. This insurance coverage requires proper documentation of individual student
participation. All students doing project work with o9-campus organizations must complete the pertinent
portion of the project registration form. In certain cases, where the project is included as part of a regular course,
the course instructor must submit to the Projects O:ce a list of the students going o9 campus and the name(s)
and address(es) of the organization(s) involved.

WPI has entered into a variety of agreements with o9-campus organizations, covering a wide range of issues
common to the projects program. Students agree to abide by these agreements during the registration for the
project.




Pay and Credit (for students working on sponsored projects)
Many WPI projects, including both the IQP and the MQP, are completed with an external partner or sponsor. It is
important to emphasize that WPI project work is di9erent from traditional internships or co-op experiences in
two important ways. First, the primary purpose of the project work is always student learning, as de<ned by the
learning outcomes associated with each project. Second, there must be a WPI faculty member advising the
project who has primary responsibility for guiding the student work, for setting the goals of the work, and
ensuring that the focus of the project remains student learning.

There do arise situations in projects sponsored by an external organization, usually a company or government
agency, when the sponsoring organization requires that the students are classi<ed as employees or interns and
receive pay in order to work on the project. In these situations, approval from the O:ce of Undergraduate
Studies is required.

WPI students may receive pay for work on an externally sponsored IQP or MQP when all of the following three
conditions are met:

1. There is documentation, shared with the students, sponsors, and the faculty advisor(s), stating that the primary
purpose of the project work is student learning.

2. WPI faculty advisor(s) have a central role in the project and have the responsibility and authority to guide and
evaluate student work done on the project. The sponsor does not assign grades or evaluate student learning.

3. The Sponsored Project Agreement and the Scope of Work document is reviewed and approved/denied by
the O:ce of Undergraduate Studies before project work begins. Proposals for pay and credit projects must be
submitted for approval/denial by the O:ce of Undergraduate Studies before the <fth day of the academic year
term (A, B, C, or D) or summer term (E1 or E2) preceding the term when project work will begin.



Note that, in order to receive academic credit, students must be registered for the project during the terms in
which project work is being done. Work performed with an external sponsor prior to registration – and outside
the three conditions described above – will not receive academic credit.



Global Projects Program
The Global Projects Program o9ers WPI students the opportunity to complete a project at one of WPI’s o9-
campus project sites. Some centers are residential, with students traveling to and living on site for an entire
term, while others o9er the opportunity to complete an o9-campus project in Worcester, Boston, or other nearby
communities. Project work conducted at these sites provides teams of students with extraordinary opportunities
to learn by addressing real-world problems provided by industry, non-pro<t, non-governmental or government
agencies.




51                                                                                             WPI 2023-24 Catalog
The application process for these programs begins in the fall with the Global Fair. At the Fair, IQP, MQP, HUA and
exchange program directors will be available to talk with students. Typically, students apply in Term A of the
year preceding the year in which they would like to participate. Further information is available at the Global
Experience O:ce in the Project Center or at https://www.wpi.edu/student-experience/resources/o9-campus-
projects.

The Global Experience O:ce strives to create project opportunities for all WPI students, but many project sites
are in high demand and students are not guaranteed a placement at their most desired site. Accepted students
must complete a series of pre-departure orientations and submit required paperwork to be eligible to travel.

All students accepted to an o9-campus IQP Center will be registered for the preparation courses (ID 2050 and
PQP) in the term immediately preceding their planned term of travel. Some preparation begins as early as two
terms prior to departure. Students must be making satisfactory progress in their academic coursework in order
to participate. Students must also follow all policies and procedures for o9-campus projects which are overseen
by the Global Experience O:ce: https://www.wpi.edu/student-experience/resources/o9-campus-projects/
policies.

Prior to leaving campus for a project program site, each student is required to complete a project registration
form.



The Interactive Qualifying Project
At WPI, students are expected to develop an understanding of how science and technology are embedded in
the fabric of society. The Interactive Qualifying Project (IQP) challenges students to address a problem that lies
at the intersection of science or technology with society. During the IQP, students work in interdisciplinary teams,
often with an external sponsoring organization, to address real world problems. In doing so, students learn
something about the role of science and technology, its impact on society, its place in meeting human needs
and human e9orts to regulate, control, promote and manage our changing technologies. The IQP is equivalent
to three courses, typically undertaken in a student’s junior year. It can be completed over three terms, or as a full
course load for a student for one term, and it can be completed on-campus, or at one of our many residential
project centers in the U.S. and abroad. For more on the IQP, visit https://www.wpi.edu/academics/
undergraduate/interactive-qualifying-project. For more on the IQP and study abroad, see the Global Projects
Program website. Completed IQP reports are electronically archived and made available to the public through
Digital WPI, managed by WPI’s Gordon Library (https://digital.wpi.edu).


IQP Learning Outcomes
The Faculty adopted the following statement de<ning learning outcomes for the IQP. Successful completion of
an IQP is an important element in helping students achieve WPI’s overall undergraduate learning outcomes.

Students who complete an Interactive Qualifying Project will:

 1. Demonstrate an understanding of the project’s technical, social and humanistic context.
 2. De<ne clear, achievable goals and objectives for the project.
 3. Critically identify, utilize, and properly cite information sources, and integrate information from multiple
    sources to identify appropriate approaches to addressing the project goals.
 4. Select and implement a sound methodology for solving an interdisciplinary problem.
 5. Analyze and synthesize results from social, ethical, humanistic, technical or other perspectives, as
    appropriate.
 6. Maintain e9ective working relationships within the project team and with the project advisor(s), recognizing
    and resolving problems that may arise.
 7. Demonstrate the ability to write clearly, critically and persuasively.
 8. Demonstrate strong oral communication skills, using appropriate, e9ective visual aids.
 9. Demonstrate an awareness of the ethical dimensions of their project work.




52                                                                                            WPI 2023-24 Catalog
Preparing for and Finding an IQP
Students are encouraged to view the IQP as a learning opportunity – a chance to gain knowledge outside their
major <eld – while working with others to address open-ended, complex problems. The best approach is to
consult with one’s academic advisor and select courses to be taken in the <rst and second year at WPI that can
provide a foundation for an IQP in the junior year. Often project preparation involves developing an
understanding of the social sciences and humanities, as the concepts and analytical techniques of these
disciplines are important in understanding the social context of science and technology. In addition, students
enrolled in the Global Projects Program for their IQP will be expected to complete a course devoted to project
preparation in advance of their travel.

Project topics originate with external organizations, faculty and students. Students who complete IQPs at an o9-
campus project center through the Global Projects Program work on project topics identi<ed by external
sponsoring organizations. Students can explore these opportunities in eProjects (eprojects.wpi.edu) and at the
Global Opportunities Fair organized each September by the Global Experience O:ce (GEO,
https://www.wpi.edu/o:ces/global-experience). Students completing projects on campus are encouraged to
seek faculty members that share their interests to advise projects. Faculty interested in advising speci<c IQPs
will post their project topics in eProjects (eprojects.wpi.edu). The Global School also hosts an On-Campus
Project Opportunities Fair each March where students can meet faculty advisors to discuss projects being
o9ered on campus during the following year.

The Global School and Global Experience O:ce o9er administrative support for project activities. Students are
welcome to seek further assistance from the sta9 on the <rst =oor of the Project Center.


What are IQPs About? Science, Technology, and Society
A detailed explanation of the IQP and its options can be found at https://www.wpi.edu/academics/
undergraduate/interactive-qualifying-project. Proposed projects can be located in eprojects.wpi.edu. IQP (and
MQP) projects are searchable in Digital WPI (https://digital.wpi.edu/).



The Major Qualifying Project
The qualifying project in the major <eld of study should demonstrate application of the skills, methods, and
knowledge of the discipline to the solution of a problem that would be representative of the type to be
encountered in one’s career. The project’s content area should be carefully selected to complement the
student’s total educational program. In de<ning the project area within which a speci<c topic is to be selected,
the student and academic advisor should pay particular attention to the interrelationships that will exist
between the bodies of knowledge represented by courses, independent studies, and Preliminary Qualifying
Projects; and by the Interactive Qualifying Projects.

MQP activities encompass research, development, and application, involve analysis or synthesis, are
experimental or theoretical, emphasize a particular subarea of the major, or combine aspects of several
subareas. In many cases, especially in engineering, MQP’s involve capstone design activity. Long before <nal
selection of a project topic, serious thought should be given as to which of these types of activities are to be
included. Beyond these considerations, the MQP can also be viewed as an opportunity to publish or to gain
experience in the business or public sectors.

O9-campus MQPs are also very valuable for access to state-of-the-art resources and contacts for future
professional work.

Getting Started on an MQP
Project topics are originated by students, faculty, or practicing professionals participating in WPI’s o9-campus
project programs. A faculty member in each academic department acts as Project Coordinator for all majors
within the department. The Project Coordinator has assembled MQP topic descriptions being proposed and has
identi<ed the faculty who will serve as project advisors for each topic. All project opportunities-MQP, IQP, PQP,
on-campus originated and o9-campus originated are made available to the student body through a planned
information-sharing program of activities during C and D terms of the academic year prior to the start of the
project.

Project Proposals
Students are strongly encouraged to begin their MQPs with a project proposal. A detailed guide to preparing
project proposals is available in department o:ces or on the Projects Program web page (https://www.wpi.edu/
academics/Projects/).


MQP Learning Outcomes
By completing their MQP, WPI students will achieve the following learning outcomes at a level at least
equivalent to that of an entry level professional or graduate student.

Students who complete a Major Qualifying Project will:

 1. apply fundamental and disciplinary concepts and methods in ways appropriate to their principal areas of
    study.
 2. demonstrate skill and knowledge of current information and technological tools and techniques speci<c to
    the professional <eld of study.
 3. use e9ectively oral, written and visual communication.
 4. identify, analyze, and solve problems creatively through sustained critical investigation.
 5. integrate information from multiple sources.
 6. demonstrate an awareness and application of appropriate personal, societal, and professional ethical
    standards.
 7. practice the skills, diligence, and commitment to excellence needed to engage in lifelong learning.

Speci<c disciplinary programs may add additional MQP outcomes, such as design or mathematical skills or
teamwork, as appropriate.


MQP Project Centers
Each project center has a WPI faculty member as the director, well-de<ned procedures for completing project
work, and selective admissions processes. The Centers tend to be highly structured and require superior
performance.

At the present time, the WPI project center close to campus is:

     • University of Massachusetts Medical School Project Center/ Tufts University Cummings School of
       Veterinary Medicine.

Major qualifying projects are available at nearby University of Massachusetts Medical School (UMMS) and Tufts
University Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine (TUCSVM) for students from many disciplines on campus.
These institutions are nationally recognized for research and medicine and o9er project opportunities over a
wide range of research areas. Students performing projects at these centers work in cutting edge research
programs and typically interact with graduate and post-doctoral researchers to solve real-world problems.

It is recommended that students spread their projects over the entire academic year. Students from any major
interested in project opportunities should contact Dr. Destin Heilman in the department of Chemistry and
Biochemistry.



Humanities and Arts Requirement
Overview
The Humanities and Arts Requirement empowers students to meet the broad educational goals of WPI. The
balance between technological and humanistic education and the emphasis on inquiry-based approaches to
student learning have been and remain hallmarks of a WPI education. In concert with WPI’s other degree
requirements, the Humanities and Arts Requirement embodies the institute’s de<nition of an educated person.
The Humanities and Arts Requirement engages students with theory and practice – Lehr und Kunst – through
the following educational goals.




54                                                                                        WPI 2023-24 Catalog
Goals of the Humanities and Arts Requirement
     • To introduce students to the breadth, diversity, and creativity of human experience as expressed in the
       humanities and arts;
     • To develop students’ ability to think critically and independently about the world;
     • To enhance students’ ability to communicate e9ectively with others in a spirit of openness and cooperation;
     • To enrich students’ understanding of themselves;
     • To deepen students’ ability to apply concepts and skills in a focused thematic area through sustained
       critical inquiry;
     • To encourage students to re=ect on their responsibilities to others in local, national and global
       communities;
     • To kindle in students a life-long interest in the humanities and arts.


Meeting the Requirement
Students ful<ll the humanities and arts degree requirement by completing two units of work consisting of <ve
student-selected courses followed by a 1/3 unit Inquiry Seminar or Practicum (HU 3900, HU 3910, or
equivalent). In selecting the courses, students must complete depth and breadth components of the
requirement, as described below. All 5 HUA courses must be completed before beginning the Inquiry Seminar or
Practicum. At the end of the Inquiry Seminar or Practicum, every student will submit a completion-of-degree
requirement form (CDR) to certify completion of the requirement.


Depth Component:
The WPI Plan calls for students to develop a meaningful grasp of a thematic area of the humanities and arts. To
ensure this depth, students complete at least three courses of thematically-related work prior to a culminating
Inquiry Seminar or Practicum in the same thematic area. Thematically-related work can be achieved in two ways:

 1. Focusing on one of the following disciplines or disciplinary areas:
      1. art/art history (AR)
     2. music (MU)
     3. theatre (TH)
     4. literature and writing/rhetoric (EN, WR, RH)
     5. history and international and global studies (HI, HU, INTL)
     6. philosophy and religion (PY, RE)

              Paths for language study are described below.

 2. De<ning the thematic area across disciplines or disciplinary areas in consultation with a Humanities and
    Arts faculty member.

To ensure that students develop a program of increasing complexity, at least one of the three thematically-
related courses that precede the Inquiry Seminar or Practicum must be at the 2000-level or above. Students are
strongly encouraged but not required to include a 3000-level course within their depth component. The
structure of the requirement remains =exible so that students will become intentional learners as they select a
sequence of thematically-related courses.


Breadth Component
To ensure intellectual breadth, before taking the 3nal Inquiry Seminar or Practicum, students must take at least one
course outside the grouping in which they complete their depth component. To identify breadth, courses are
grouped in the following manner:

     •   art/art history, theatre, and music (AR, TH, MU);
     •   languages (SP, GN, ISE, AB, CN);
     •   literature and writing/rhetoric (EN, WR, RH);
     •   history and international and global studies (HI, HU, INTL);
     •   philosophy and religion (PY, RE).




55                                                                                            WPI 2023-24 Catalog
WPI o9ers a =exible curriculum to entrust students with a signi<cant amount of choice and responsibility for
planning their own course of study. At the same time, WPI requires students to take at least one course outside
the depth area in order to provide exposure to more than one disciplinary approach within the arts and
humanities, which include the creativity of the <ne and performing arts, modes of communication in languages
and literature, and the cultural analysis of the past and present. Students are encouraged to experiment and to
take courses in more than one group outside the depth area if they wish. By providing exposure to multiple
areas, the breadth component encourages students to appreciate the fundamental unity of knowledge and the
interconnections between and among diverse disciplinary <elds.

The one exception to this breadth requirement is that students may take all six courses in a foreign language.


Depth and Breadth Components in Modern Languages
Development of pro<ciency in a language necessitates sustained engagement in the language beyond the
elementary and intermediate level. Language instruction is broadly interdisciplinary and includes elements of
the history, literature, and culture of a particular language area. A student in languages must still meet the depth
component of the requirement by taking 6 courses in the language, one of which is approved as the <nal Inquiry
Practicum or Seminar. Additional information about options for the Inquiry Practicum or Seminar in Chinese (CN),
English for Non-Native speakers (ISE), German (GN) and Spanish (SP) can be found later in this section. A student
who begins language study is not compelled to remain in that subject, but could choose to switch to another
subject of study and complete the depth component in another thematic area.


Inquiry Seminar or Practicum
The culmination of the depth component of the Humanities and Arts Requirement is an inquiry seminar or
practicum. The educational goals for the seminar or practicum are the same regardless of the format.


Objectives of the Inquiry Seminar or Practicum
  • Critical inquiry: to develop each student’s ability to apply concepts and skills learned in the humanities and
    arts, the seminar/practicum o9ers opportunities to engage in sustained critical inquiry, analysis, or
    problem-solving in a focused thematic area.
  • Research and investigation: to engage students in research, discovery, creativity, or investigation, the
    seminar/practicum provides opportunities for students actively and critically to seek and evaluate new
    information and insights using multiple sources. These opportunities need not necessarily be research
    papers.
  • Communication and writing: to develop each student’s ability to communicate e9ectively both orally and in
    writing, the seminar/practicum includes discussion of appropriate communications skills and provides
    opportunities to revise written work after receiving feedback from the instructor.
  • Intellectual independence: to foster independence of thought, the seminar/practicum o9ers signi<cant
    opportunities for individual, self-directed work.
  • Conversation and dialogue: to promote individual re=ection and the appreciation of diverse perspectives,
    the seminar/practicum consists of classroom activities other than traditional lecture to encourage
    discussion and collaborative learning in a spirit of openness, cooperation, and dialogue with peers. The
    thematic focus, structure, and assignments for each seminar or practicum are to be determined by each
    individual instructor to achieve these goals.


Inquiry Seminar
The Inquiry Seminar, usually taken in the sophomore year, represents the culmination of the Humanities and Arts
Requirement. The Seminar provides an opportunity for students to explore a particular topic or theme in the
humanities in greater depth. The Seminar has two primary goals. The <rst is to foster independence of student
thought, typically through some form of self-directed activity. The second is to encourage a cooperative,
dialogic approach to inquiry, through open exchanges with peers in a small, intensive classroom setting
(typically 12 students or fewer). Students learn how to frame questions in the context of a particular discipline or
<eld of study, and to explore or investigate problems using methods appropriate to work in the humanities and
arts.

As the student’s capstone experience in the humanities and arts, the Inquiry Seminar is intended to help
students take their knowledge of the humanities to a higher level. The purpose of the Inquiry Seminar, therefore,


56                                                                                           WPI 2023-24 Catalog
is not to provide a broad survey or general introduction to a given discipline, but to provide a structured forum in
which students might approach a speci<c humanities-related problem or theme at a deeper, more sustained
level of intellectual engagement than would normally be possible within a traditional course setting. The
pedagogical idea behind the Inquiry Seminar is that work in the humanities and arts is at once an intensely
personal enterprise, in which the individual freely draws on her or his own particular interests, abilities, passions,
and commitments, and at the same time a form of ethical community in which the practitioner is always in
conversation with and accountable to others.

While the speci<c content and requirements of the Inquiry Seminar vary from instructor to instructor, all Inquiry
Seminars incorporate self-directed learning as a signi<cant part of the curriculum. It is the department’s
expectation, therefore, that by the time they enroll in the Seminar, students should have su:cient background in
the humanities and arts to be able to work independently and to pose questions of their own. Students will be
asked to research and write a term paper, to assemble a portfolio of writings or exercises, or otherwise to
demonstrate their ability to pose a question of relevance to humanities inquiry, and to answer it. At the same
time, the Seminars are designed to foster an atmosphere of intellectual collaboration and discovery. Students
are required to participate fully in seminar discussion, to share the results of their own research or activities, and
to engage the ideas and interests of their peers in a constructive and collegial way.


Practicum in Humanities and Arts
Students in the performing arts have the option to complete their Humanities and Arts sequence with an Inquiry
Practicum in music or theatre. A practicum shares the same goals and objectives of an inquiry seminar but
provides students with a production/performance experience which emphasizes the hands-on, practical
application of skills and knowledge gained from previous Humanities and Arts courses. Samples of practicums
in music include composing, arranging, or performing a solo recital. Theatre students may choose to work on a
campus production in a number of production roles, including but not limited to acting, directing, dramaturgy,
design, technical production, or management. In addition to weekly meetings, students may be required to
attend rehearsals, performances, and other production-related activities. The design of the <nal project is
determined through conversations between instructors and students. Due to the unique nature of the
practicum, permission of the instructor is required to enroll in a practicum.


Languages: Practicum or Seminar
Students in languages may complete the Humanities and Arts Requirement in one of the following three ways:

 1. Practicum in the sixth and 3nal course in a language. The practicum will include evaluative components or
    exams to demonstrate overall language skills in four areas: listening, speaking, reading, and writing. The
    practicum will require students to demonstrate breadth of cultural knowledge of the language area.
    (Examples of practicum courses: CN 2544, CN 3544, GN 3512, GN 3515; SP 3522; SP 3527)
 2. Advanced language seminar after 3ve previous courses in the language. The seminar will explore a thematic
    topic and provide opportunities for individual inquiry. (Seminar examples: GN 3513, GN 3514; SP 3523, SP
    3524, SP 3525, SP 3526, SP 3528, SP 3529, SP 3530, SP 3531)
 3. Advanced language seminar after advanced-level language courses combined with courses from other areas
    of study. Students who demonstrate basic oral, written, and cultural knowledge of a language in a
    placement test at the advanced level may combine courses from other areas for their requirement.
    (Seminar examples are the same as option 2.) International students who are non-native speakers may take
    a combination of ISE and WR courses and ful<ll the HUA requirement by taking a 3000-level or above ISE/
    WR project-based course.



Option 1 and 2 require students to take six courses in a language. For example, in option 1, a student without
prior language training might begin with GN 1511 Elementary German I and conclude with a practicum in GN
3512 Advanced German II. In option 2, for example, a student might start with SP 2521 Intermediate Spanish I
followed by <ve Spanish courses which culminate in one of the designated seminars. In option 3, students who
demonstrate knowledge of the language at the advanced level may mix courses from other areas in their
course sequence. For example, a student might take two courses from history, philosophy, music, etc. along with
four advanced Spanish courses which would culminate in a designated seminar. Students in the English
language track might begin with three ISE courses, take one WR course, one from history, and conclude with a



57                                                                                             WPI 2023-24 Catalog
3000-level ISE/WR course. Students in all three options for languages would be required to submit the same
materials to demonstrate completion of the requirement as students whose culminating experience was an
inquiry seminar or practicum in another area of the Humanities and Arts.

AP Credit Policy
The Humanities and Arts Department will accept a maximum of 1/3 unit of AP credit towards the Humanities
and Arts requirement. Students who score a 4 or 5 on the AP test in German or Spanish automatically receive
1/3 unit of credit in the language, provided they do not begin German or Spanish study at WPI with Elementary
German I (GN 1511) or Elementary Spanish II (SP 1523). Students who score a 4 or 5 on the AP test in studio art
may be eligible for HUA credit, subject to a portfolio review by art faculty. Students who score a 4 or 5 on the AP
test in other subject areas of the humanities and arts will receive credit in the relevant discipline. AP credit
beyond one course (1/3 unit) in the Humanities and Arts may be counted toward other requirements such as
free elective credit or particular majors and minors at WPI.


Transfer Students and the Humanities and Arts Requirement
Students who transfer fewer than six Humanities and Arts courses from another institution must complete an
inquiry seminar or practicum to complete the Humanities and Arts Requirement. Students who transfer six or
more courses in Humanities and Arts will have the option of submitting a CDR form or engaging in additional
work (or documentation of work) to earn an “A” on the CDR, in accordance with current transfer rules (see below).




59                                                                                           WPI 2023-24 Catalog
All students may have the option of completing their Humanities and Arts Requirement while enrolled for 1 unit
of coursework at an o9-campus project center where one-third unit of the coursework shall include an inquiry
seminar or practicum.

Transfer credit in the Humanities and Arts at WPI is granted on a course-for-course basis. All Transfer students
entering WPI with fewer than six courses or their equivalent of transfer credit in the Humanities and Arts must
complete work in the Humanities and Arts, including an Inquiry Seminar/Practicum to the extent that the overall
Humanities and Arts credit totals two units.

No credit toward the Humanities and Arts Requirement is given for introductory-level foreign-language courses
unless the entire program is in that foreign language. Usually only one transfer course in Freshman English can
be applied toward the requirement. In all cases, the professor for the Inquiry Seminar/Practicum has the <nal
decision on what courses are acceptable within the student’s sequence leading up to the project. Up to one unit
(i.e. three courses) of transferred work in the Humanities and Arts that is not credited toward the Humanities and
Arts Requirement can be credited toward the <fteen-unit graduation requirement; such courses shall receive
credit under the category of EL 1000.

If a Transfer student has completed two units of acceptable college-level work in the Humanities and Arts prior to
entering WPI, a Completion of Degree Requirement form will be submitted by the Humanities and Arts
Department Coordinator for Transfer Students at the request of the student. The grade for such a Humanities
and Arts Requirement met by transfer credit is normally a grade of “CR”. Students whose grades on transferred
courses average A can engage in additional work or submit samples of their previous work and may be awarded
an A for the Humanities and Arts Requirement. Alternately a transfer student may elect to undertake an Inquiry
Seminar/Practicum in an e9ort to achieve an A grade. These evaluation options must be exercised prior to the
Department’s submission of the Completion of Degree Requirement form to the Registrar.

Decisions concerning credit toward the Humanities and Arts Requirement are made by the Humanities and Arts
Coordinator for Transfer Students, Professor James Hanlan. He can be contacted in room 28 of Salisbury
Laboratories, or at extension 5438, or email jphanlan@wpi.edu.


Guidelines for Granting Transfer Credit to U.S. Students for Foreign Language Study
A. Credit for study on the high school level:

 1. Transfer credit of 1/3 unit is given for Advanced Placement with a score of 4 or 5.
 2. Students with three or more years of foreign-language study in high school, but who have not taken the
    Advanced Placement examination in that language, may receive 1/3 unit credit for their high school
    language study upon satisfactory completion of two courses in the same language on the intermediate
    level or above. (Note: Courses in Chinese, German and Spanish in addition to those o9ered at WPI, as well
    as courses in other languages, are available at other colleges in the Consortium.)
 3. In either case 1. or 2. above, in order to receive 1/3 unit credit, students must begin their WPI course
    sequence at the Elementary II level or above.

B. Credit for study at other colleges and universities:

 1. Language study which is done at other universities and colleges prior to entering WPI, or done with the
    prior written permission of the student’s Humanities and Arts Consultant (not the Department Head) as part
    of an agreed-upon Humanities and Arts sequence, transfers on a course-for-course basis.
 2. Language study which is done at foreign universities, language institutes, cultural institutes, etc., prior to
    entering WPI, or done with the prior written permission of the student’s Humanities and Arts Consultant (not
    the Department Head) as part of an agreed-upon Humanities and Arts sequence, is assessed by the
    Foreign Languages Consultant on the basis of matriculation papers and the level of work accomplished.


Other Options
Interdisciplinary Study at the American Antiquarian Society
A unique opportunity for interdisciplinary work in the humanities and arts is o9ered by the American Studies
Seminar sponsored each fall by the American Antiquarian Society. Organized in collaboration with Worcester’s
<ve undergraduate colleges and universities, this seminar focuses on topics that allow students to investigate
the Society’s rich holdings in early American history, literature, and culture. The Society’s unparalleled collection


60                                                                                             WPI 2023-24 Catalog
of documents is a short walk from the campus. Information on application deadlines and academic credit
toward the Humanities and Arts Requirement is available from the WPI Campus Representative to the American
Antiquarian Society.

O5-Campus Option: Humanities and Arts Project Centers
WPI o9ers the option to complete the Humanities and Arts Requirement during one term of study at several
Project Centers. Normally, students complete the requirement through at least six courses or independent-
study projects on campus. However, the “O9-Campus” option allows students to combine at least three courses
on campus with one term studying the humanities and arts at a Project Center. Students may use this option to
complete the requirement.

O9-campus projects are available in Germany and Argentina for the study of foreign languages and in England,
Taiwan, Japan, and Morocco for other <elds. Students devote themselves to one term studying the history,
literature, language, or culture at the project center with a WPI faculty advisor. The program might combine a
thematic seminar in an area of the faculty advisor’s expertise with visits to museums, the theatre, musical
performances, or cultural excursions. Although themes or areas of emphasis vary from year to year, all o9-
campus Humanities and Arts activities culminate in a written report in an area of interest to the student.

To be eligible for participation, students must have already completed three courses in humanities and arts
before they leave campus. Students may apply to the o9-campus program before they have taken all three
courses. In addition, students going to any Project Center must complete all of the forms required by the
Interdisciplinary and Global Studies Division.

Requirements:
     • Students must have completed at least three courses in the Humanities and Arts at WPI, or have earned
       equivalent course credit approved by the Humanities and Arts Department, before the term of the o9-
       campus activity. The Department may allow students to count transfer or advanced placement credits
       toward the three course minimum;
     • Students must be accepted into the o9-campus Humanities and Arts program by the Humanities and Arts
       Department, and complete all forms required by the Interdisciplinary and Global Studies Division, in order
       to register for these projects.
     • Students might be required by the faculty advisor to complete a PQP or attend required meetings before
       the o9-campus project;
     • Students must submit a written report or paper at the end of the program. Students also may be required
       to submit written updates at various times in the course of the program. In all cases, the faculty advisor at
       the project center will determine the precise form of the written requirements.
     • Students may be required to give an oral presentation at the end of the program;
     • Under normal circumstances, students must complete the program within one term in order to receive the
       full unit of credit;
     • Only members of the Humanities and Arts faculty at WPI may advise o9-campus Humanities and Arts
       programs.


O5-Campus Recommendations
All o9-campus programs bene<t from advance planning. Discuss the possibility of an o9-campus activity with
your academic advisor at the beginning of the freshman year. Consult with the WPI faculty who will advise these
o9-campus programs as early as possible, since they may be able to suggest useful courses or other
background resources for the projects. Also keep in mind that three courses are the minimum required, but
many students <nd it advantageous to take additional courses before going away.

The interdisciplinary programs are open to students with a background in areas of the humanities and arts
besides foreign languages, including art history and architecture, drama/theatre, history, literature, music,
philosophy, religion, or writing/rhetoric. After taking at least three courses in any of these areas on campus, you
could then go to a HUA project center to complete your requirement. Some students also have participated in
this program to study beyond the Humanities and Arts Requirement for a minor in international and global
studies, history, literature, music, theatre, or other areas.

The Humanities and Arts Department advertises upcoming program locations and application deadlines at the
Global Fair each September. Future programs might include other locations that provide the context for an
intensive study of humanistic themes associated with particular locales within the United States. Contact the
Department of Humanities and Arts for more information.




The Social Science Requirement
The goals of the Social Science Requirement are to give students the opportunity to:

1. Study human society, including human thought and behavior, politics, ethics, human-environment
relationships, public policy, economics, and technology;
2. Learn to think critically about social issues and problems, particularly those at the interface of society and
technology;
3. Become inspired and develop the skills necessary to help solve social problems throughout their academic
and professional careers.

What Counts

Any two courses taught in the Social Science & Policy Studies Department may be counted toward the Social
Science Requirement, including all courses with one of the following pre<xes: ECON, ENV, DEV, GOV, PSY, SD,
SOC, SS, STS.

One-third unit of a Great Problems Seminar course may be counted, but only if the GPS is co-taught by a faculty
member with at least a half-time appointment in the SSPS Dept.

The project preparation course SS/ID2050 may be counted toward the Social Science Requirement. However,
we recommend that students use the requirement to fully explore their interest and develop a knowledge base
in one or more of the following social science disciplines: economics, environmental studies, political science &
law, psychology, system dynamics, or science, technology, and policy.

Students interested in obtaining WPI credit for a social science course taken at another institution should
consult our transfer credit authorization policies and procedures available at: https://www.wpi.edu/academics/
study/programs/social-science-policy-studies/resources

What Doesn’t Count

Courses taught in the Humanities & Arts Department or the School of Business do not count toward the Social
Science Requirement. Courses taught in STEM Departments or programs that address social implications (e.g.,
CS 3043, IMGD 2000) do not count. The course ID 3100 does not count.

Why Stop at Two Courses?

The Department of Social Science and Policy Studies has a variety of majors and minors that will contribute to
your WPI experience, improve your career prospects, and provide additional perspective to your degree. Reach
out to a faculty member to determine which minor or major is right for you.

Depth or Breadth?

The requirement allows students a choice of focusing on depth or breadth in the social sciences. Students who
are unsure which social science disciplines are of most interest or value to them may use the requirement to
explore two di9erent areas. For example, students may take one course in economics and another in
psychology, or one in environmental studies and another in government/policy. Students who have more

de<ned interests may focus on depth, taking both an introductory and advanced course in the same discipline
(e.g. Introduction to Environmental Studies and Environmental Problems in the Developing World). Students are
welcome to contact the various program directors to learn more about the di9erent social science courses.

When

We recommend that students complete the 2-course Social Science Requirement prior to beginning their IQP.
The social science courses can help students identify interests and make more informed and rewarding choices
for their IQP project. They will also provide social science knowledge and analytical skills that can enable
projects to succeed.

Double Counting

Courses taken to ful<ll the Social Science Requirement may overlap with the distribution requirements of any
major. For example, students majoring in Management are required to take two courses in economics. Those
two courses can count toward both the Management major and the Social Science Requirement.

Questions?

Questions about the Social Science Requirement may be directed to our Social Science Requirement
Coordinator, Prof. Lisa Stoddard (eastoddard@wpi.edu, X5284, 310F Salisbury Labs).

Want more? How about a social science minor? (You’re 2/3 of the way there!)

The Social Science Requirement calls for a minimum of two courses. But students who want to bring depth to
their WPI experience and their resumes are encouraged to use their free electives to pursue additional courses or
a minor. If the two courses that count toward the SS requirement are in the same discipline, only 4 additional
courses are required to obtain a minor in economics, environmental studies, psychology, law & technology, or
system dynamics. For more information or questions about minors, see one of the following program liaisons:

Economics: Prof. Alex Smith (adksmith@wpi.edu, X6543, 310B SL)

Wellness and Physical Education Requirement
Wellness and Physical Education Requirement
To provide an understanding and experience in Wellness and Physical Education to gain awareness for lifelong
well-being to thrive personally and professionally, every student must complete a Wellness & Physical
Education requirement.

Quali<cation in wellness and physical education shall be established by completing 1/3 unit of course work.
Students may take classes multiple times for credit. We do not o9er independent study options in Wellness and
Physical Education. In addition to PE 1000-series course o9erings, students may satisfy their PE requirement by
the following:

 1. WPI approved varsity athletic team participation (PE 2000-series). Student must be registered with
    instructor permission in advance of participation. No retroactive credit will be awarded if failure to register.




63                                                                                             WPI 2023-24 Catalog
 2. Club Sports (PE 1200-series). Students must be members of a PE approved club prior to becoming eligible
    for physical education credit and by meeting established department policies for credit. Students must be
    registered in advance of participation; no retroactive credit will be awarded if failure to register in advance.
    Additional fees for some clubs may apply.
 3. Approved courses not o9ered at WPI; advance approval by the Physical Education Department is
    necessary so students are encouraged to contact the department directly in advance to review. No
    retroactive credit will be awarded if failure to receive advance approval.
 4. Participation in certain ROTC programs may entitle students to a receive PE credit. Students in ROTC
    programs should review in advance with their respective commanders.

GENERAL PHYSICAL EDUCATION COURSES
(PE 1000 series)

This series is o9ered to provide a variety of courses in the more traditional sport-based area of physical
education. These courses can serve the beginner to the more experienced in each activity area. PE 1000 series
courses meet twice a week (generally between 8am-5pm) at predetermined times with attendance and
participation major factors in a student’s <nal grade.

HEALTHY ALTERNATIVE PHYSICAL EDUCATION COURSES
(PE 1099)

These PE courses are o9ered to provide a variety of wellness, dance and healthy alternatives to traditional PE
sport-based classes. These classes are subject to change on a yearly basis in order to provide =exibility in the
PE o9erings based upon the latest trends in wellness and dance. The focus of these classes is more on
individual <tness, wellness and education, with instruction provided to all students in the classes.

THE CLUB SPORTS PROGRAM (PE 1200-series)

Club Sports are activities in various sports and wellness that are organized and recognized by
Student Government Association as Class II organizations and open to any undergraduate student. Students
who are properly registered in advance for the club activity in their interest area (more information regarding
Club Sports can be found at wpi.edu/+techsync) and meet the established criteria for participation by the club
as well as by PERA department policy, may be eligible for PE course credit. Practice and/or competition times
vary but are generally in the evenings and weekends. Participating students may incur additional fees for
equipment, travel, and/or uniforms.



Individually Sponsored Residential Projects (ISRPs)
Through the Individually Sponsored Residential Projects (ISRP) process, faculty may design custom o9-campus
projects in addition to the established options available at WPI Project Centers. ISRPs are subject to an approval
process through the DIGS that includes routine planning and risk management protocols employed for the
Global Projects Program.

Consult the Global Portal at https://www.wpi.edu/+globalportal for ISRP Process Deadlines. Please contact DIGS
at global@wpi.edu with any questions about the ISRP process.

This center supports and helps to coordinate project work (both MQPs and IQPs) in all aspects of energy and
across all areas of academic inquiry at WPI. A goal is to promote the use of innovative technologies and
approaches to meet on-campus, regional, and global energy challenges. The principles of sustainability, with
consideration to economics, the environment, and social justice, are emphasized in all of the Center’s activities.
The Center’s objectives are to



64                                                                                            WPI 2023-24 Catalog
support and to facilitate the organization of project teams and advisors to address problems involving
sustainability and energy. Areas of interest range from traditional and renewable forms of energy to the use of
systems approaches to address the relationships between energy and societal needs such as buildings,
transportation, food and water. Center activities include the following: communication of WPI’s activities in the
energy area both internally and externally; establishment of a clearinghouse for project topics and the formation
of project teams; organization of a forum for discussion of major energy-related topics, highlighting excellent
energy-related projects; and identifying externally-sponsored projects. For more information contact Prof. Paul
Mathisen (mathisen@wpi.edu).


STEM Education Project Center
Director, Kathy Chen

The heart of the STEM Education Project Center is captured in the quote by Leila Janah, “Talent is equally
distributed but opportunity is not.” Projects associated with this Center focuses on transforming PreK-12 Science,
Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education to be high-quality, equitable, and culturally
relevant. With the goal of improving PreK-12 STEM education opportunities for all children, our objectives
include: 1) providing engaging and inclusive STEM activities to diverse audiences, 2) examining the educational
opportunity gaps in di9erent contexts, and 3) supporting informal and formal educators in STEM. Some projects
may be to design, develop, and test hands-on, standards-aligned, PreK-12 STEM; to examine STEM education in
a global context; and to develop sustainable relationships between WPI and local non-pro<ts around STEM
opportunities. In addition, the teaching practicum requirement in the Teacher Preparation Program is typically
done as an IQP during A&B or C&D terms. These projects (MQPs and IQPs) are in partnership with the STEM
Education Center at WPI and PreK-12 schools, afterschool programs, non-pro<ts, and educators. Faculty are
invited to bring projects under the STEM Education Project Center. For more information, please contact Kathy
Chen (kcchen@wpi.edu) and go to https://www.wpi.edu/+stem.


Sustaining WPI Project Center
Co-Directors, Suzanne LePage and Derren Rosbach

There is a great deal of interest in enhancing the sustainability of WPI – both as an institution and as a campus.
The Sustaining WPI Project Center was developed to support and coordinate project work (primarily IQPs)
developed around these interests. Project topics are proposed by the project teams based on their sustainability
interests and in coordination with faculty advisors and the WPI O:ce of Sustainability. The intent is to address all
aspects of sustainability as outlined in the WPI Sustainability Plan: campus facilities, the educational curriculum,
research and scholarship, as well as civic engagement. The Center sponsors IQPs in D-term each year with
student preparations beginning in C-term. For more information contact Suzanne LePage (slepage@wpi.edu).

University Procedures

Administrative Obligations and Holds
The college reserves the right to hold grades, transcripts, registration and/or diploma for any student who has
an outstanding administrative obligation with the college.



Early Completion
Students completing 100% of WPI graduation requirements by the end of A-term or C-term will be eligible for a
50% tuition adjustment for the semester of completion. Eligible students must complete the form available in
the Registrar’s O:ce and submit by the end of B-term (for C-term completion) or D-term (for A-term
completion). Students/responsible parties will be billed for the full semester and then tuition charges will be
reduced by 50% once the graduation requirements have been signed o9 and the student’s withdrawal has been



66                                                                                         WPI 2023-24 Catalog
o:cially processed. Quali<ed students receiving <nancial aid from WPI will retain 50% of any WPI scholarship,
and their loan eligibility will be reviewed on an individual basis. Students living in WPI housing will still be
<nancially responsible for paying the full semester’s worth of room and board.

Students are permitted to enroll in a maximum of 4/3 units (12 credits), excluding PE, in either A or C term.
Students registered beyond 4/3 units will be charged the overload fee.



Double Major
Distribution Requirements
The distribution requirements of each major must be met, but requirements common to both majors may have
to be met only once. A minimum of three units of qualifying project work is thus required for ful<llment of the
project portion of the double major requirements: one unit in each of the two major areas of study, and one unit
of an IQP.

For students wishing to pursue double majors not involving social science, the program audit for each intended
major must be completed and certi<ed by the review committee of each department involved. Academic
activities appropriate to both majors may be counted in both majors..

If a student wishes to complete two Interdisciplinary (individually designed) Majors Programs, the double major
must be proposed in a single Educational Program Proposal, which must be approved by the student’s Program
Advisory Committee for each major. The Committees shall ensure that the majors are substantially non-
overlapping.

If a student’s double major includes an Interdisciplinary (individually designed) Major Program, the double
majors must be described in the Educational Program Proposal for the Interdisciplinary Major.



Designation of Class Year
Class year will normally be designated as year of matriculation plus four with the additional requirement that the
accumulation of 34/3 units is necessary for fourth-year status, 22/3 units for third-year status, and 10/3 units for
second-year status. The class year of transfer students will be determined on an individual basis. Class year
designations will be reviewed at the end of Term E each year and changed if the credit accumulation does not
meet the above speci<cations. After Term E, students may petition to be redesignated in their original class if
they meet the minimum unit requirements.



Directory Information and Release of Information
The items listed below are designated as “Directory Information” for each student: campus mailbox, full name,
year, major, advisor, e-mail address, permanent address, local address, local phone, photograph, date and place
of birth, dates of attendance, enrollment status, degrees and awards received, and most recent or previous
educational agency or institution.

Under the provisions of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA), the institution is
permitted to release Directory Information without a student’s consent. A student, however, has the right to
restrict the disclosure of any or all of their Directory Information. Written noti<cation to withhold Directory
Information must be received by the Registrar’s O:ce during the <rst week of the fall semester/A term. Forms
are available in the Registrar’s O:ce or on the Registrar’s website. A request to restrict the disclosure of Directory
Information does not restrict internal use of such by the institution.

Unless a student noti<es the Registrar’s O:ce in writing to the contrary, the college considers all undergraduate
students to be dependents of their parents. In compliance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act,
the college reserves the right to disclose information about the status of dependent students to their parents
without the students’ written consent. Petition forms for Declaration of Independent Status are available in the
Registrar’s O:ce upon request (see information under Distribution of Grades).

Policy on Releasing Information on Deceased Students
The education records of deceased students may be released or disclosed, at the time of death, upon written
request, to a spouse, a parent, the executor of the estate, the eldest surviving child, the eldest surviving sibling,
and surviving descendent, or pursuant to a court order or subpoena. Only the Registrar may release the
academic records of deceased students. The person requesting the records must provide as much of the
following information as possible within the written request:

Student’s name (and maiden name, if applicable).
Student’s Social Security number.
Student’s date of birth.
The dates that the deceased student attended WPI.
Death Certi<cate (Photo copy is acceptable).
The petitioner must also provide the following personal information within his/her written request:

  • Name.
  • Address.
  • Phone Number.
  • Evidence that he/she is quali<ed to receive the records, based on the above criteria or, in the absence of
    evidence, a statement certifying the same.
  • Signature.
  • Date of request.



O6-Campus Programs
All o9-campus programs o9er students the opportunity to complete a project in one term of full-time work.
Advance preparation is required. Faculty advisors are in residence at IQP sites and some Humanities and Arts
and MQP sites.

More details about current o9-campus program o9erings, including an up-to-date list of program locations can
be found on eProjects. Find a listing of all global project centers here.



Academic Standing
Satisfactory Academic Progress
In order to assist the student, parents, and the academic advisor in determining whether a student is making
academic progress, WPI has adopted the following guidelines.

To maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress, a student must:

 1. Complete at least 4/3 units of academic work for the fall semester (A and B terms); and
 2. Complete at least 4/3 units of academic work for the spring semester (C and D terms).

Note: Air Force Aerospace Studies (AS), Military Science (ML), and Wellness and Physical Education (WPE)
courses are not included in any evaluation of Academic Progress.

Academic Progress is evaluated at the end of each semester and any student who does not maintain
Satisfactory Academic Progress will move down one level of academic standing (to warning, from warning to
probation, or from probation to suspension). First-year students who earn no academic credit (see note above)
during their <rst two terms at WPI will be placed on Academic Suspension. Thereafter, any student who earns
no academic credit in a semester will move down two levels in academic standing.


Academic Warning
Each student’s academic record will be reviewed at the conclusion of terms B and D according to the guidelines
above. If a student’s performance falls short of either guideline 1 or 2, the student will be placed on Academic
Warning for two terms. At this time, the student is urged, with the help of the advisor, to identify the nature of the


68                                                                                             WPI 2023-24 Catalog
academic di:culty and to formulate a course of action for overcoming the di:culty. Students on academic
warning may apply to the Global Projects Program, but WPI reserves the right to withdraw acceptance to
students who are subsequently placed on academic probation.


Academic Probation
During the next review of academic progress, should the student fail, once again, to maintain satisfactory
academic progress, the student will be placed on Academic Probation for two terms. Academic Probation will
prevent the student from receiving <nancial aid, will result in loss of eligibility for team sports, will prevent the
student from obtaining undergraduate employment in the Co-op Program and will prevent participation in the
Global Projects Program.


Academic Suspension
Should a student on Academic Probation fail to make satisfactory academic progress during the next review
period, the student will be suspended from WPI. This status will prevent the student from enrolling as a full-time
student or a part-time student for at least the next two terms. Subsequent readmission is subject to approval
(with possible conditions) of a petition through the Registrar to the Committee on Academic Operations (CAO).
As a general rule, a student readmitted after suspension will be placed on an Academic Probation status.

New students (<rst year or transfer) who fail to obtain academic credit for the <rst two terms shall be placed on
Academic Suspension and not allowed to enroll for the following two terms. To apply for readmission, a student
must submit a petition to the Committee on Academic Operations (CAO).


Improvement in Status
Students on Academic Warning or Academic Probation have the opportunity to improve their status by
progressing through the levels in reverse order. If a student on Academic Probation satisfactorily meets the
guidelines at the end of the next review period, he or she will be moved to the list of students on Academic
Warning. A student on Academic Warning would be moved back to Satisfactory Academic Progress status.


Summer Review Period
An exception to the guidelines stated above can occur when a student registers for Term E. At the conclusion of
Term E, a review will be conducted which will include E-term and the previous four terms. If the student has
completed 10/3 units acceptable work, the student’s academic progress status will improve. Thus, a student on
Warning status after the Term D review will start terms A and B on Satisfactory Academic Progress. A student
placed on Academic Probation after the Term D review will be on Warning status for terms A and B.


Summer Academic Success Program
Students who <nish the academic year on Academic Warning or Academic Probation status, but who have
passed at least 2 units of academic work during the previous four terms, are eligible to participate in the
Summer Academic Success Program. Students who participate in the program enroll in ID 1000- Summer
Academic Success Program, a <ve-week academic skills course, as well as two E Term courses. Successful
completion of the courses and ID 1000 will result in the academic status rising one level (Academic Probation to
Academic Warning, or Academic Warning to Satisfactory Academic Progress). The O:ce of Academic Advising
coordinates the Summer Academic Success Program.


Part-time Students
Students pursuing the bachelor’s degree as part-time students will be subject to the same review schedule and
standards as full-time students. All part-time students will be reviewed after the Fall and Spring semesters and
must satisfactorily complete at least one-third of the academic activities for which he/she has registered. For
more information on part-time status, click here.


Grade Changes and Academic Status
Students who are placed on Academic Warning or Academic Probation at the end of a given semester may
receive a grade change (either incomplete to letter or letter to letter) that may improve the standing. The



69                                                                                              WPI 2023-24 Catalog
Registrar will re-review a student’s standing if the grade change comes in by the last day of the immediately
following term. Please note that, depending on the timing of this re-review, the improved standing may not have
an e9ect on <nancial aid implications. This option is not available to students on suspension. Suspended
students must petition the Committee on Academic Operations for reconsideration or to return from suspension.


Petitions
Students may petition through the Registrar’s O:ce to the Committee on Academic Operations (CAO) for
reconsideration of the status of the following:

  • Academic Probation
  • Academic Suspension
  • Readmission after Suspension

Students who petition for reconsideration of status must accomplish the following:

 1. Obtain a petition form from the Registrar’s O:ce webpage.
 2. Complete the form and obtain advisor’s approval and signature.
 3. Submit the form to the Registrar’s O:ce within three weeks of the issuance of grades for B, D, or E term
    reviews except for readmission after suspension.


Deadlines for Readmissions a6er Suspension
July 20 for Term A

November 15 for Term C



Registration and Enrollment

Registration
During the spring, students will receive information regarding course o9erings for the following academic year.
After consulting with academic advisors, students will make course selections via the online registration system.
Students with holds will be prevented from registering until the obligation is met.

A calendar is published by the Registrar’s O:ce prior to the add/drop period which speci<es the time periods
and fees for late changes. Students are responsible for the dates and should contact the Registrar’s O:ce if they
need information to avoid late fees. Requests for exceptions to published deadlines must be submitted in
writing to the Registrar’s O:ce and will be granted based on documented extenuating circumstances, i.e.,
medical, military obligations.


Course Changes
There is an add/drop period at the start of each term and the exact deadlines depend on the length of the
course session (7, 10, or 14 weeks).

For 7-week courses (undergraduate and graduate), a student can add a course without a fee through the <fth
day of classes. On the sixth through the tenth day of classes, students can add courses (with instructor approval)
with a $100 late fee. Students can drop courses on days 1-10 of each term without incurring a late fee. For
undergraduates in 7-week courses, no adds or drops are allowed after the tenth day of the term. For graduate
students in 7-week courses who drop a course after the tenth day, but before the end of the <fth week of the
term, a W (Withdrawal) will be assigned. No tuition or fees will be refunded after the tenth day of the term.

For 14-week courses (undergraduate and graduate), students can make course changes (add or drop) without
penalty through the tenth day of the semester. A $100 late fee will be charged for course adds after the tenth
day of the semester and instructor permission is required. No drops are allowed after the tenth day of the


70                                                                                          WPI 2023-24 Catalog
semester; for graduate students, course withdrawals are permitted through the tenth week of the semester, and
a grade of W (Withdrawal) will be assigned. No tuition or fees will be refunded after the tenth day of the
semester. Consult the University calendar for speci<c dates.

For 10-week courses (undergraduate and graduate), students can make course changes (add or drop) without
penalty through the tenth day of the semester. A $100 late fee will be charged for course adds after the tenth
day of the semester and instructor permission is required. No drops are allowed after the tenth day of the
semester; for graduate students, course withdrawals are permitted through the seventh week of the semester,
and a grade of W (Withdrawal) will be assigned. No tuition or fees will be refunded after the tenth day of the
semester.

Note: If a degree-seeking student is dropping or withdrawing from all registered course activity, they must either
take an institutional leave of absence or o2cially withdraw from the University.


Wait Lists
When a seat in a class becomes available to a student on the wait list, they will be noti<ed via e-mail. The e-mail
contains instructions on how to claim the available seat. If a student does not receive an e-mail, it means no seat
is available for them in the wait-listed class.


Overloads of Courses
The standard course load for WPI students is one unit per term (exclusive of courses for ROTC and Wellness
and Physical Education, which do not count towards overloads). Students may register in advance for a
maximum of one unit in any term.

Registration for courses which will result in an overload may take place, on a space-available basis, after all
current undergraduate students have had the opportunity to register for classes. This date will be posted on
the Registrar’s website.

Students are strongly encouraged to consult with their academic advisor before registering for an overload.

Overload charges will be computed each semester based on the course and project load based on the
student’s registration after the add/drop period in the second term of the semester.

Note: undergraduates taking graduate courses receive more credit for said courses and are billed accordingly.
Please take this into account when considering overload fees.


Withdrawal from Courses
Students who wish to withdraw from a course or project will be assigned a grade of NR (No Record) by the
instructor. The student should contact the instructor and indicate that they will not be continuing in the class.



Records and Audits
Transcript Fees
All o:cial transcript requests must be made online and carry a fee per transcript.

Independent Study
Independent Study provides the opportunity for an individual student or group of students, with the approval
and under the direction of one or more faculty advisors, to study and to explore in greater depth an area of
particular interest to the student and faculty member. An independent study may be used as a substitute for an
existing WPI course, as an opportunity to study a topic not currently o9ered as a course at WPI, or to conduct
directed undergraduate research.

Independent Study registration for terms A-E will be accepted up to the 10th day of the term (not including
weekends) without penalty.

An independent study may be used to assign credit in a particular discipline only when at least one of the
faculty advisors has an appointment in the department or program associated with the discipline or with the
approval of the appropriate Department Head or Program Director. If disciplinary credit is not assigned to the
independent study, the academic credit will be identi<ed as Interdisciplinary (ID) and the credit will be assigned
as free elective on the student’s transcript.



O6icial Withdrawal or Leave of Absence
There are many reasons why a student may need or wish to take time away from WPI. There may be personal or
medical issues interfering with their academics; opportunities for professional experience; family or community
commitments; or the desire to just take a break.

     • Institutional Leave of Absence (LOA): Request this if you are planning to return to WPI. Leaves may be
       granted for the remainder of the current semester (if applicable) and the immediately following semester
       (not counting summer). Leaves may be renewed for one additional semester, and an extension must be
       requested before the expiration date of the current leave. If a student does not return by the expiration
       date, they will be automatically withdrawn. For students with federal funding in their <nancial aid awards
       you will be reported to federal agencies as a federally withdrawn student. This may have impacts on
       deferment and loan repayment start times. Please contact the O:ce of Student Aid & Financial Literacy for
       further details.
     • O:cial Withdrawal: Request this if you are leaving permanently and not planning to return to WPI.

Any reduction in charges is based on the student’s certi<ed last date of attendance.

Students who have attended through the 12th week of a semester (or the 5th week of B or D terms) may not
withdraw or take an LOA for that semester and will be academically reviewed. They may withdraw or take an
LOA for the following semester.

See Return from Leave of Absence section for information about returning to WPI after a leave. Students who
o:cially withdraw are expected to apply through Undergraduate Admission if they decide they would like to
return at a later date to pursue undergraduate study.

See full list below for more information and other types of withdrawals or leaves.

Deadlines:
Fall Semester: July 15th
Spring Semester: December 1st
Summer Session: May 1st



Part-Time Degree Students
Students may apply for Part-Time Student status on a semester basis at the Registrar’s O:ce. Part-time
students pay tuition on the basis of registered credit at the start of each semester, including credits for ROTC
and PE. Campus housing will not be allowed. Part-time students may not engage in varsity/club sports, may not




73                                                                                               WPI 2023-24 Catalog
participate in any extracurricular activities, and are only eligible to apply for limited federal and state <nancial aid
(institutional <nancial aid is not available) including any form of on-campus student employment. The following
registration procedures apply:

     • Students who wish to enroll as part-time students must apply by July 20 for the Fall semester and by
       November 15 for the Spring semester. Such status will allow a maximum of one unit per each semester of
       the academic year.
     • Changing between full-time/part-time status is not allowed at mid-semester.
     • Part-time students wishing to return as full-time students must be readmitted according to the procedures
       speci<ed under Readmission in the Admissions section of this catalog



Non-Degree Students
Students wishing to take courses on a full-time or part-time basis as a non-degree student may do so by
contacting the Registrar’s O:ce. Non-degree students are permitted to earn a maximum of 18 credits (6/3rds) in
a non-degree status. Non-degree students will be tracked through the Registrar’s O:ce. Non-degree students
pay tuition on the basis of registered credit at the start of each semester. Campus housing will not be allowed.
Non-degree students may not engage in varsity/club sports, may not participate in any extracurricular activities,
may be required to register for courses on a space-available basis, and are not eligible for 3nancial aid or any
form of on-campus student employment.



Summer Session (Term E)
With course o9erings directed at meeting student needs, a variety of sessions, and both traditional and online
classes, E-term provides =exibility for students looking to work over the summer and still take advantage of
these academic opportunities. E-term is a great time to

     •   Speed up your time to degree completion
     •   Stay on track in the BS/MS program
     •   Lighten the load for the next year
     •   Get back into good academic standing

E-term o9ers an exceptional opportunity to participate in certain types of project activity on a convenient basis
since classrooms and laboratories will be less crowded and outside <eld work will enjoy better weather
conditions. E-term also o9ers an excellent opportunity to complete a qualifying project through a full-time e9ort
during a single term.

Since class sizes are generally smaller in E-term, students will enjoy more individually-oriented course work – a
real bene<t for classes that students <nd challenging or courses that are designed to prepare students for more
advanced classes in their major.

Students planning to participate in Term E should register at the regular spring registration period. For more
information, including payment and <nancial aid information, visit the E-term webpage at: https://www.wpi.edu/
academics/undergraduate/summer-courses/current-wpi-students

Students from other campuses are also invited to take advantage of E-term o9erings at WPI. Admission to the
summer session does not imply admission to regular academic year programs. Students desiring to continue
their work at WPI following the summer session should seek admission following standard WPI admissions
procedures issued through the Admissions O:ce.



Graduate Courses
WPI students may enroll in graduate courses as part of their regular undergraduate studies without being
admitted to the graduate program. An exception: In order to enroll in graduate courses o9ered by The Business
School, the student must have been admitted to a dual BS/MS program, regardless of department.



74                                                                                               WPI 2023-24 Catalog
E9ective in the fall 2011 semester, Undergraduate students taking graduate courses may use the conversion
factor: 1 graduate credit = 1/6 undergraduate unit. The policy was put into place to recognize the additional
academic challenge of graduate studies with an appropriate increase in academic credit. All credit increases will
be manually processed through the Registrar’s O:ce and may not be completed the same day of registration;
therefore, your initial bill may not re=ect the credit conversion.

Please note that this change might have an impact on students’ planning, especially if enrolled in a BS/MS
program. More importantly, it also can impact overload calculations. Here are some examples:

     • If a student is registered for 5 undergrad courses and 1 grad course: the student has 5/3 plus 1/2 units (or 2
       and 1/6 units total) => No overload
     • If a student is registered for 3 undergrad courses and 3 grad courses: the student has 3/3 + 3/2 units (2 and
       1/2 units total) => 1/6 unit overload

Please note that the standard course load for WPI students is one unit per term (exclusive of ROTC and Physical
Education classes, which do not count toward overloads). Students who register for more than 7/3 (or 21 credits)
per semester will be charged accordingly. Overload charges are computed at the beginning of B term and at
the beginning of D term based on the course and project load included in the student’s <nal term registration.
Please note that project work is credit-bearing and is included in overload calculations.



Transfer Students
Transfer Agreements & Transfer Credit
WPI currently holds formal articulation agreements with speci<ed programs of studies at Quinsigamond
Community College. However, WPI will grant appropriate transfer credit from any accredited two-year or four-
year institution.

WPI is able to o9er a transfer credit evaluation once a transfer student is admitted. For incoming <rst year
students, the transfer credit evaluation process is available after the enrollment deadline of May 1st, typically
beginning in mid-May. Admitted transfer students and newly enrolled <rst year students should follow the WPI
transfer credit guidelines, policy and procedure available at www.wpi.edu/+transfercredit, which included a list
of transfer equivalencies to date. The Transfer Admissions team coordinates the process with WPI faculty who
evaluate the coursework to determine credit eligibility. Each academic department at WPI reviews courses
under their program, and provides a decision to the Transfer Admissions team. Admissions communicates any
credit updates to the WPI Registrar’s O:ce as well as WPI Academic Advising. In general, courses that are the
academic equivalent of a WPI course with a grade of a B or better will be considered for transfer credit.
College-level and lab-based chemistry and biology, calculus, calculus-based physics with lab, engineering
science, and most social science and humanities and arts courses are typically considered for transfer credit. To
be eligible for credit review, the courses must be completed on a college campus taught by college instructors.
Early college, early entrance programs, or college coursework provided in partnership with a college or
university but o9ered at the high school taught by high school teachers are not eligible for credit at WPI, with
the exception of Project Lead The Way (PLTW). Online coursework is also typically not eligible. Additional
courses that are not transferable include pre-calculus, non-calculus based physics or engineering science, and
computer courses in BASIC.

Humanities & Arts Requirement for Transfer Students
As part of the WPI Plan, all WPI students must complete the Humanities and Arts Requirement. As such, all
transfer students should review their humanities and arts coursework accepted for transfer credit at WPI and
plan with the Humanities and Arts Department’s coordinator for transfer students to determine next steps
towards the completion of the HUA Requirement. All transfer students entering WPI with fewer than two units of
humanities and arts credit must complete thematically related work in humanities and arts. This will include an
inquiry seminar or practicum to the extent that the overall humanities and arts credit totals two units. The HUA
Requirement is considered ful<lled for transfer students who have completed the equivalent of two units of
humanities and arts work prior to their matriculation at WPI. A Completion of Degree Requirement form (or CDR)
must be submitted once the HUA Requirement has been satis<ed. This form can obtained at the WPI Registrar’s
O:ce, and will be completed by the Humanities and Arts Department coordinator for transfer students. For



75                                                                                             WPI 2023-24 Catalog
those transfer students who have satis<ed the HUA Requirement based on work completed at their previous
institution(s) and who submit the approved CDR form to the WPI Registrar’s O:ce will have this information
posted to their student account. This process normally takes place prior to or during the <rst term of full-time
enrollment at WPI.


Special Programs

Special Programs for New Students
New Student Orientation
During the week prior to classes, the Student Activities O:ce and the O:ce of Academic Advising coordinate a
comprehensive new student orientation program for all <rst-year and transfer students. New student orientation
provides an introduction to the WPI experience, ranging from academic work and expectations and project-
based education, to student life and campus activities. Led by upperclass student team leaders and Insight
advisors, new students attend team meetings that are designed to familiarize them with the overall campus
environment.


Insight Program
Beginning with New Student Orientation and continuing through the <rst semester, incoming <rst year and
transfer students are assigned to an Insight Team, a group of students and advisors dedicated to assisting with
the transition to college. This group of fellow students and mentors will help new students acclimate both
personally and academically, and make the most out of their <rst year at WPI.


Connections Pre-Orientation
The Connections Pre-Orientation is a week-long residential bridge program at Worcester Polytechnic Institute
(WPI) held in August prior to New Student Orientation (NSO) and the Insight Program. Connections helps
entering eligible new and <rst-year students make a smooth transition from high school to college.

The Connections Academic Immersion Experience allows new students to have a jump start and introduction
to the WPI course structure (in a low stakes environment), an opportunity to meet WPI faculty, and form
relationships with peers while learning college study skills and helpful methods for navigating through WPI.
Participants who choose to take a summer course in E-Term will also have the opportunity to attend workshops
in the Fall semester (A-Term and B-Term) which build upon the experiences and skillsets students bring to WPI
and cover additional topics such as faculty and sta9 mentoring, major exploration, and guidance on course
selection. This will be a time to reconnect with your Connections peers and a place to ask those questions you
might have.

The Connections Pre-Orientation Program is o5ered at no cost to pre-registered eligible 7rst-year WPI
students. See the website for more information.


Great Problems Seminars
This is a two course sequence designed to serve as an introduction to project work and university level research
with a focus on themes of global importance. Each seminar has at its core an important problem. Students
explore the complexity of our global issues, and demonstrate their ability to solve some aspect of the big
problem. The skills the students develop are exactly what they need to be successful both in project work at
WPI and in their future careers.

Examples: In Food Sustainability, students and faculty focus on issues surrounding food: nutrition, production,
economics, and policy issues. Student projects have included plans for urban gardens, extending Meals on
Wheels to younger but non-mobile seniors and nutritional information in the dining hall.




76                                                                                           WPI 2023-24 Catalog
In Power the World, the production, distribution and use of all forms of energy and associated ethical issues are
reviewed. Student projects have included stove design for indigenous people, improvements on solar-powered
emergency medical devices and energy audits of campus buildings.

Themes will change from year to year. Enrollment is limited.


Discovering Majors and Careers
Discovering Majors and Careers is a class for <rst year students undecided about academic majors. This 1/12
unit course can be taken on top of a regular course load. Students enrolled in this course will utilize a variety of
tools including self-assessments, panels, campus resources, and informational interviews with alumni to help
identify personal interests, WPI majors, related careers, and life goals.

Cooperative Education
Cooperative Education - Undergraduate

Co-op

The WPI Cooperative Education Program (Co-op) is an opportunity for undergraduate students to alternate time
in the classroom with extended periods of paid, full-time, career-related work experience in industry or
government. This optional program can be done during the following scenarios:

 1.   Summer plus A term
 2.   Summer, A term and B term
 3.   C term, D term and Summer
 4.   D term and Summer
 5.   Summer, A term, B term, C term and D term
 6.   A term, B term, C term, D term and summer

Most students elect to participate in one Co-op assignment, though up to two is possible. Because Co-op is not
a credit-baring program, it is recommended that students pre-plan during their <rst or second year. Preparation
of a complete four year plan with the student’s academic advisor is required to ensure compatible scheduling of
work periods and academic courses.

In order to qualify for the Co-op program, students must meet the following requirements:

 1. Must be a current, full time, undergraduate WPI student in good standing. Note: If any of the following
    conditions apply a student may petition for eligibility.
      1. Not in good academic standing (i.e. on academic warning or probation)
      2. Have <nancial holds on their account
      3. Have a judicial record. Note: having a judicial record does not automatically preclude you from
         participating in a Co-op.
      4. Want to register for up to 1/3 unit of course while on Co-op.
 2. International students must complete one full academic year at WPI before being eligible for Co-op, due to
    US Federal Government regulations. In addition, the Co-op must be related to the major (not minor). For
    questions, please contact International House.
 3. Understand the impact Co-op would have on your federal and institutional <nancial aid through a meeting
    with the O:ce of Student Aid & Financial Literacy.



77                                                                                             WPI 2023-24 Catalog
 4. Understand the impact your Co-op will have on your course schedule and outline your four year plan,
    including projects, Co-op, etc. and have it reviewed through a required meeting with your Faculty Advisor.
 5. Approval will be needed from your Faculty Advisor, O:ce of Student Aid & Financial Literacy, Supervisor at
    your Co-op, Bursar, Dean of Students O:ce, Career Development Center (CDC), and International House (if
    applicable). Approvals are done electronically through Handshake, beginning with you entering your Co-op
    information in your Handshake Account’s Experiences section. The deadline for fall Co-op application is
    August 1; the deadline for spring Co-op application is December 1. Co-op applications received after
    deadline are reviewed on a case by case basis. Submissions after the add/ drop deadline will not be
    approved.
 6. To be considered, the Co-op must be full time (at least 30 hours per week), paid, 4-8 months in duration
    and related to your major and career goals.
 7. Understands and accepts the Terms of Agreement. (see website for more information)

Advantages for Students

Co-op o9ers several advantages for students:

 1.   Gain experience, build their resume and bring theory into practice.
 2.   Earnings enable students to pay a signi<cant portion of their college expenses.
 3.   Sharpen skills and abilities as an emerging professional.
 4.   Test out career options to help clarify career goals and interests.
 5.   Return to school with new knowledge and experience in their <eld.
 6.   Position themselves for future opportunities; Co-op participants are preferred full time hires.
 7.   Transcript will show Co-op and indicate company name.

Societies, Registration and Licensing
Engineering Societies
All engineers are professionals in accordance with the de<nition of engineering, one of which states that
“engineering is the profession in which a knowledge of the mathematical and natural sciences gained by study,
experience and practice is applied with judgment to develop ways to utilize, economically, the materials and
forces of nature for the bene<t of mankind.” Professional engineers also observe a code of ethics, exercise
judgment and discretion while providing their services, and are involved in a con<dential relationship with their
clients. Professional engineers enjoy legal status, use professional titles, and associate together through
professional societies.

An excellent way to begin learning about the status of the professional engineer is to join the student branch of
a professional society relevant to your interests. At WPI, students are encouraged to join the student branches of



78                                                                                            WPI 2023-24 Catalog
such societies as the American Academy of Environmental Engineers and Scientists (AAEES), American Society
for Metals (ASM), American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), the Institute of Electrical and Electronic
Engineers (IEEE), the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), the American Institute of Chemical Engineers
(AIChE), the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA), the Association of Computing Machinery
(ACM), the American Nuclear Society (ANS), APICS, the Institute of Industrial Engineers (IIE), the National Society
of Black Engineers (NSBE), the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), the Society of Manufacturing Engineers
(SME), the Society of Fire Protection Engineers (SFPE), the Society of Women Engineers (SWE), the American
Chemical Society, (ACS), the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE), and Women in
CyberSecurity (WICyS). For information on these organizations, see the appropriate department head.

Engineering Registration and Licensing
In order to become a “Professional Engineer” (P.E.) and enjoy the legal status which a9ords certain rights,
privileges and responsibilities, engineers must qualify through the formal procedures of registration and
licensing. Procedures vary from state to state, but in most cases, the applicant must <rst pass a Fundamentals of
Engineering Examination.

Fundamentals of Engineering Examination
To become legally registered as a professional engineer (P.E.), candidates must submit data regarding formal
education and technical ability to the appropriate state Board of Registration for Professional Engineers. Two
major examinations, The Fundamentals of Engineering Examination (also called Engineering-in-Training, E.I.T.)
and the Professional Practice Examination (P.P.E.), must be successfully completed as a measure of technical
ability. The Fundamentals Examination must be taken <rst; the Professional Practice Examination must then be
taken after a designated period of substantial professional experience, usually a minimum of four years. The
Fundamentals Examination and Professional Practice Exams are administered year-round.

There are several possible quali<cation paths to registration as a P.E. The quickest and most common route is to
obtain a degree from an ABET (Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology-formerly ECPD) accredited
curriculum, and to acquire the speci<ed amount of suitable professional level experience in addition to passing
the two examinations mentioned above. There are seven ABET accredited curricula at WPI-biomedical
engineering, civil engineering, chemical engineering, electrical and computer engineering, environmental
engineering, industrial engineering, manufacturing engineering, and mechanical engineering. Persons with an
unaccredited degree can still become registered in most, but not all, states by submitting evidence of a longer
“apprenticeship” period (variable by states) before taking the two examinations. Students should strive, if at all
possible, to pursue a program which is accredited by ABET and should work closely with their advisors and
appropriate major departments to assure that the total program quali<es for accreditation, since this will greatly
facilitate the achievement of registration in the future.

ALL SENIOR ENGINEERING MAJORS IN BME, CE, CHE, ECE, AND ME ARE URGED TO TAKE THE
FUNDAMENTALS OF ENGINEERING EXAMINATION WHICH IS GIVEN ON CAMPUS EACH FALL AND SPRING.
There will never be a better time!

Refresher courses for students, alumni and practicing engineers are available. Successful completion of this
examination is normally the <rst step in eventually obtaining the right to use the initials “P.E.”

WPI’s O:ce of Continuing Education sponsors an eleven session EIT Refresher course from mid-January
through mid-April on the WPI Campus. The course, which is taught by WPI faculty, includes reviews of the major
topics covered on the exam. For further information, call 508-831-5517.

Description of Fundamentals of Engineering Examination (F.E.E.)
Typical Date Given: Last Saturday in October (also in April).
Typical Application Deadline: First week in September (also in January).
Duration: Eight hours.
Type: Multiple choice, open book.

Student Exchanges
As technology and commerce become increasingly international in outlook, students in engineering, science
and business must learn about countries and cultures other than their own. To respond to this need, WPI o9ers
its students an extensive range of opportunities to broaden their academic and cultural perspectives through
participation in the Global Projects Program. WPI also o9ers traditional exchange programs.

The principal academic emphasis in all exchanges is upon course work. In such programs, students must work
closely with their advisor, the academic advisor of the exchange program, and the program coordinator at the
site to design an individual program of study. Students have the responsibility of obtaining prior tentative
approval from their department that courses taken abroad will count towards departmental distribution
requirements. For <nal transfer credit evaluation, students must provide upon return the necessary detailed
information on the content of courses taken abroad and the satisfactory completion of all work. In some
exchanges, opportunities exist to complete project work (IQP, MQP, and Humanities and Arts requirement). The
exchanges o9er exceptional possibilities for projects comparing American and overseas applications of
technology and the impact of technology on society. For WPI students on these exchanges, time is usually
available for additional travel, before or after the formal academic period.

For more information on these programs, consult with the Global Experience O:ce in the Project Center or the
academic advisor listed for each program.

Language Requirements
The usual language of instruction at most of the exchange institutions is the o:cial language of the host country.
While these institutions may o9er a few courses taught in English, most lectures will be given in a foreign
language. Thus, exchange students who intend to complete substantial course work must acquire the
necessary language background. In some cases intensive language instruction can be arranged on site. In other
cases, students acquire the language background through courses taught at WPI or other colleges, or by self-
study. A few exceptions exist at some technical universities where the o:cial language of instruction may be
English.

University of Applied Sciences; Konstanz, Germany; Exchange
Students who already know German or are planning to begin studying it have the opportunity to study in
Germany for a semester at the Hochschule für Technik, Wirtschaft und Gestaltung (HTWG: university of applied
sciences; http://www.htwg-konstanz.de/) in Konstanz, Germany. The city of Konstanz, located at the western
end of Lake Constance (in German, der Bodensee) and right on the border with Switzerland, is one of Germany’s
most beautiful cities, with a well- preserved medieval and renaissance city center. The snow- covered Alps are
visible across the lake and the HTWG campus is on the bank of the Rhine where it =ows out of the lake and
heads north. The city is pedestrian friendly, has great food, and there are unlimited opportunities for biking,

Combined Bachelor/Master’s Program
Introduction
WPI undergraduates can begin work on a graduate degree by enrolling in a combined Bachelor’s/Master’s
program. This accelerated course of study allows students to obtain an MS degree after only <ve years of full-
time work (i.e., typically one year after completion of the BS). Students often obtain the BS and MS in the same
<eld or department, but with careful planning some students complete the combined BS/MS program in two
di9erent <elds; the combination of a BS in Civil Engineering and an MS in Fire Protection Engineering is a
common example. (Throughout this section, “MS” will be used to refer to all Master’s-level degrees; most
students who complete the combined program obtain the MS).

Planning your Program
Because BS/MS students use some approved courses to satisfy the requirements of both degrees
simultaneously, it is crucial for them to plan their curriculum early in their undergraduate career.

The speci<c course and MQP requirements for a BS/MS program are determined individually, so students
should consult with their own advisor as well as the graduate coordinator in the department in which they plan
to pursue their MS degree early in their Junior year. This consultation, or series of consultations, should produce
a slate of approved undergraduate courses that will be used for graduate credit. Sometimes the instructors of
these courses will ask BS/MS students to complete additional work, or will otherwise hold them to higher
standards of achievement.

A student’s advisor and graduate coordinator will also determine what role the MQP will play in the BS/MS
program. Sometimes the MQP provides a foundation for a thesis. In cases where the BS and MS are not awarded
in the same <eld, the MQP usually relates to the graduate program’s discipline.

Once the speci<c course and MQP requirements have been established, students complete a Course Selection
Form which is submitted to the relevant department(s) for approval. This written agreement constitutes the set
of conditions that must be met for a student to complete the BS/MS program. They are a plan for completing
the requirements for both degrees and they will not supersede or otherwise obviate departmental and
university-wide requirements for either degree. The completed, signed form must be submitted to the Registrar
before the student may matriculate in the combined program.

How to Apply
Students almost always apply for admission to the BS/MS program in their Junior year, typically after they have
established their curriculum and other program requirements and completed the Course Selection Form with
their faculty advisors. Applications are submitted to the O:ce of Graduate Admissions and are processed with
all other graduate applications. Once a decision has been reached, the O:ce of Graduate Admissions will notify
the student, usually within six weeks of completing the application.

Program Requirements
Only registered WPI undergraduates may apply for admission to the combined BS/MS programs. Students are
considered undergraduates, no matter what courses they have completed, until they have met all of the
requirements for the Bachelor’s degree. In order to receive the BS and the MS, all of the requirements for both
degrees must be completed.

In most departments a student may take up to four years to complete the Master’s portion of the BS/MS
program. There are exceptions, however, so students are advised to discuss their timetable with the appropriate
advisor or graduate coordinator. Students who stop registering for classes for an extended length of time may
be asked to petition the Committee for Graduate Studies and Research to continue their program.




81                                                                                           WPI 2023-24 Catalog
Credit Equivalence and Distribution
No more than 40% of the credit hours required for the Master’s degree, and which otherwise meet the
requirements for each degree, may be used to satisfy the requirements for both degrees. In some departments,
students may not double-count more than 30% of their graduate credits. Consult the graduate catalog for the
requirements of your program.

E9ective in the fall 2011 semester, Undergraduate students taking graduate courses may use the conversion
factor: 1 graduate credit = 1/6 undergraduate unit. The policy was put into place to recognize the additional
academic challenge of graduate studies with an appropriate increase in academic credit. All credit increases will
be manually processed through the Registrar’s O:ce and may not be completed the same day of registration;
therefore, your initial bill may not re=ect the credit conversion.

Please note that this change might have an impact on students’ planning, especially if enrolled in a BS/MS
program. More importantly, it also can impact overload calculations. Here are some examples:

  • If a student is registered for 5 undergrad courses and 1 grad course: the student has 5/3 plus 1/2 units (or 2
    and 1/6 units total) => No overload
  • If a student is registered for 3 undergrad courses and 3 grad courses: the student has 3/3 + 3/2 units (2 and
    1/2 units total) => 1/6 unit overload

Please note that the standard course load for WPI students is one unit per term (exclusive of ROTC and Physical
Education classes, which do not count toward overloads). Students who register for more than 7/3 (or 21 credits)
per semester will be charged accordingly. Overload charges are computed at the beginning of B term and at
the beginning of D term based on the course and project load included in the student’s <nal term registration.
Please note that project work is credit-bearing and is included in overload calculations.


Campus Resources
Academic Advising
WPI’s advising program is based on a cooperative and understanding relationship between students and
advisors. Under the WPI Plan, students have the <nal responsibility for designing their own educational
experience at WPI which includes understanding all their degree requirements and making sure those
requirements have been satis<ed for graduation. Advisors will support students in doing so.

All WPI students are assigned an academic support advisor in the O:ce of Academic Advising upon
matriculating to WPI. These advisors are not major speci<c and will work with the student throughout their time
at WPI to provide holistic and individualized academic support. In the second semester of the <rst year, students
are also assigned a Faculty Advisor who is a professor in the student’s chosen major. The two advisors work in
tandem to support students in their academic pursuits and pathway to graduation.

The role of both the academic support advisor and the faculty advisor is to help their advisees design a program
of study which re=ects the students’ interests and professional goals. While advisors are willing to suggest
speci<c programs of study and help students explore the academic opportunities WPI has to o9er, they will not
insist that students follow a particular path. Advisors also help students choose among academic alternatives,
help interpret degree requirements and review their Academic Progress Reports. Students are expected to
understand curriculum planning resources such as the Program Tracking Sheets and Academic Progress
Reports and their implications for academic progress. Therefore, it is critical that students take the initiative to
consult regularly with their academic advisors for help with curriculum planning and course selection.

The O:ce of Academic Advising at WPI has several areas of focus, including but not limited to: 1) general
academic advising; 2) academic resources; 3) transition programs; 4) Pre-Health programs; 5) nationally
competitive scholarships and fellowships advising;




82                                                                                           WPI 2023-24 Catalog
General Academic Advising
Students can come to the O:ce of Academic Advising for general advising in areas such as course selection,
academic standing concerns, major selection, and individualized academic coaching. Support is also o9ered for
students looking to include a co-op experience or pursue a BS/MS program. Academic support advisors are
available to meet with students throughout the year for any of the reasons above, and may provide drop-in
support at various times of the academic year such as add/drop periods and course registration. Academic
support advisors may refer students to their Faculty Advisor when appropriate. Students are encouraged to
meet with their Faculty Advisor for major-speci<c support.

The academic coaching program, primarily geared toward students on Academic Warning and Probation or
who are at risk of being on Warning or Probation, includes guidance from an Academic Advisor in areas such as
learning styles, e9ective study strategies, problem solving and critical thinking skills, organization, and time
management. Students work on setting academic goals and designing learning and study strategies that work
best for them.


Academic Resources Center
The Academic Resources Center (ARC) is located on the 5th =oor of Unity Hall and houses the academic
tutoring program and MASH (Math and Science Help). Peer tutors and MASH leaders are students who have
demonstrated a mastery of material, and have been trained in peer tutoring and communication.

MASH is an academic support program for students enrolled in math and science classes. O9ered to all
students in a supported course, MASH provides assistance through regularly scheduled weekly study sessions
beginning the <rst week of every term.

MASH review sessions are o9ered for a limited number of courses which students and faculty have identi<ed as
challenging. Many of the courses are typical <rst year classes, allowing extra support for students transitioning
to college-level work. Each session is guided by a MASH leader, an undergraduate student who has taken the
course before and has excelled. They understand the course material and what the instructor expects.

Through the MASH and tutoring programs, students become actively involved with the content material in a
supportive environment. Studies show that students who attend MASH or tutoring regularly earn higher grades
than students electing not to participate. Even more importantly, they learn how to master new concepts, learn
how to put ideas into perspective, develop a better way to study, and e9ectively manage their time.


Transition Programs
The O:ce of Academic Advising oversees programming for First Year students (including the Insight Program)
and sophomore students. OAA also provides speci<c programs and advising opportunities tailored to the unique
needs of students transferring to WPI from other institutions.

Insight Program: Beginning with New Student Orientation and continuing through the <rst semester, incoming
<rst year and transfer students are assigned to an Insight Team, a group of students and advisors dedicated to
assisting with the transition to college. This group of fellow students and mentors will help new students
acclimate both personally and academically, and make the most out of their <rst year at WPI.


Pre-Health Advising
The Pre-Health Advisor works with students who are interested in pursuing careers in the health professions.

Students may meet with the Pre-Health Advisor to
   a) explore various careers in healthcare and receive assistance in selecting the most suitable path for
themselves;
   b) receive advice regarding pre-requisite courses and other preparation for various health professions
programs (e.g. medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, optometry,
   physician assistant studies, physical therapy among others;
   c) receive assistance throughout the professional school application process, including the arrangement of a
committee recommendation letter;
   d) take advantage of academic coaching or receive general help.

Special programming is o9ered throughout the year for Pre-Health students. To get connected with the Pre-
health Advisor, students may email academic-advising@wpi.edu.


Scholarships and Fellowships Advising
Nationally competitive scholarships and fellowships are selective awards that provide <nancial and professional
support for individuals who exhibit interest in a particular area or <eld of study and who are likely to make
positive contributions and advancements in their <eld.

These awards are available to help fund undergraduate education, graduate school, international study, and
many provide additional bene<ts including access to alumni networks, employment opportunities, and
conference funding. Funding from each scholarship is provided for a speci<ed amount of time such as an
academic year or for several years.

The O:ce of Academic Advising provides students with support and guidance with the application process for
these highly competitive awards. This includes assistance in understanding the nomination process, feedback
on application materials, support in determining suitable letter writers, and submission of the <nal application to
the scholarship foundation for selected nominees.

Many national scholarships and fellowships require o:cial nomination from WPI, which entails an on-campus
selection process. Students who are interested in being considered for institutional nomination for a scholarship
opportunity can connect with the O:ce of Academic Advising for additional information regarding nomination
procedures. For more information click here.

Cooperative Education
Cooperative Education - Undergraduate

Co-op

The WPI Cooperative Education Program (Co-op) is an opportunity for undergraduate students to alternate time
in the classroom with extended periods of paid, full-time, career-related work experience in industry or
government. This optional program can be done during the following scenarios:

 1.   Summer plus A term
 2.   Summer, A term and B term
 3.   C term, D term and Summer
 4.   D term and Summer
 5.   Summer, A term, B term, C term and D term
 6.   A term, B term, C term, D term and summer

Most students elect to participate in one Co-op assignment, though up to two is possible. Because Co-op is not
a credit-baring program, it is recommended that students pre-plan during their <rst or second year. Preparation
of a complete four year plan with the student’s academic advisor is required to ensure compatible scheduling of
work periods and academic courses.

In order to qualify for the Co-op program, students must meet the following requirements:

 1. Must be a current, full time, undergraduate WPI student in good standing. Note: If any of the following
    conditions apply a student may petition for eligibility.
      1. Not in good academic standing (i.e. on academic warning or probation)
      2. Have <nancial holds on their account
      3. Have a judicial record. Note: having a judicial record does not automatically preclude you from
         participating in a Co-op.
      4. Want to register for up to 1/3 unit of course while on Co-op.
 2. International students must complete one full academic year at WPI before being eligible for Co-op, due to
    US Federal Government regulations. In addition, the Co-op must be related to the major (not minor). For
    questions, please contact International House.
 3. Understand the impact Co-op would have on your federal and institutional <nancial aid through a meeting
    with the O:ce of Student Aid & Financial Literacy.
 4. Understand the impact your Co-op will have on your course schedule and outline your four year plan,
    including projects, Co-op, etc. and have it reviewed through a required meeting with your Faculty Advisor.
 5. Approval will be needed from your Faculty Advisor, O:ce of Student Aid & Financial Literacy, Supervisor at
    your Co-op, Bursar, Dean of Students O:ce, Career Development Center (CDC), and International House (if
    applicable). Approvals are done electronically through Handshake, beginning with you entering your Co-op
    information in your Handshake Account’s Experiences section. The deadline for fall Co-op application is
    August 1; the deadline for spring Co-op application is December 1. Co-op applications received after
    deadline are reviewed on a case by case basis. Submissions after the add/ drop deadline will not be

Student Development and Counseling Center
The SDCC’s team of experienced professionals is here to support your mental health, emotional well-being, and
interpersonal growth. We o9er a variety of clinical services––including short-term individual counseling, group
sessions, and crisis interventions––and will partner with you to identify the tools, resources, and strategies that
can help you meet your academic, social, and personal goals. This might take one session, or it might require a
little more support. Either way, you are not alone, and we are here to support you on your WPI journey.

Some of the ways the SDCC supports students are:

Short-term Individual Counseling: While the length of counseling may di9er, all <rst sessions at the SDCC
begin with an Intake Appointment. The intake appointment at the SDCC is typically 25-minutes where you and
the therapist will discuss your presenting concern(s), clarify and work on goals for treatment, and then they
will work to make a recommendation about next steps. These next steps may include following up as needed,
joining a group, helping a student connect with specialists in the area, or other options as appropriate. The SDCC
clinician will talk through the Scope of Services with students and recommend next steps.

Con7dentiality: The SDCC is dedicated to creating an inclusive, respectful, and comfortable environment where
students can share openly and work with counselors to set goals, identify obstacles, and move in a positive
direction. Con<dentiality is taken very seriously, and only under certain, very speci<c conditions—outlined in
the con<dentiality policy (PDF)—will counselors share information outside of the SDCC.


92                                                                                           WPI 2023-24 Catalog
Group Sessions and Workshops: The SDCC o9ers a variety of groups and workshops focused on student need.
These groups may change from term to term. Participating in a therapeutic group can be a helpful resource for
students to use both as a stand-alone tool for support, or as an adjunct to individual therapy. Not only will you
have the ear of a trained therapist and counselor, but you’ll have an opportunity to connect with peers and form
new relationships, provide and receive support to/from others, and discover that you are not alone.

Crisis Support: The SDCC can connect students to crisis support options if needed. If you are on-campus or
living close to WPI: During normal working hours call the SDCC (508-831-5540). Our services are available
whether you live on- or o9-campus. If you are o5-campus or away from WPI: Call 911 or go to your nearest
emergency room.

After-hours Crisis Support line: Calling ProtoCall (508-831-5540) is a great <rst step, as the crisis counselor you
connect with can help you determine if you need a higher level of intervention or not. Call Campus Police or 911
if you are concerned about yourself or the immediate safety of someone else.

We know reaching out for help is not easy. We have added an online scheduling tool to make it easy for
students to schedule appointments, and our after-hours telehealth line (508-831-5540) connects students
to trained mental health professionals after normal business hours and on weekends/holidays.

Additionally, the SDCC hosts trainings, workshops, and presentations that are designed to foster personal
growth and skills for success.

Students interested in learning more about the SDCC and its services are encouraged to email us at
sdcc@wpi.edu, call us at 508-831-5540, or visit us during our operating hours. The main o:ce is located at #16
Einhorn Road. We are open Monday-Friday 8am-5pm. Our summer hours are Monday-Friday 8am-4:30 pm.


Academic Departments and Programs

Major Interdisciplinary Programs

Pre-Professional Programs

Pre-Law Programs
Advisor: K. Rissmiller
Law schools do not require that undergraduates complete any particular course of study. Thus, students who
complete degrees in engineering and science (or other WPI programs of study) may wish to consider careers in
law. Undergraduates interested in attending law school are encouraged to choose from among the many
courses o9ered which explore legal topics. For those with greater interest, WPI o9ers a Minor in Law and
Technology described on page 121. Courses with substantial legal content are listed among those courses
ful<lling the requirements of the minor.

Enrolling in these courses will introduce students to the fundamentals of legal process and legal analysis.
Students will study statutes, regulations and case law. These courses will, therefore, o9er the student valuable
exposure to the kind of material commonly studied in law schools and they may help demonstrate a student’s
interest to law school admission committees.



93                                                                                           WPI 2023-24 Catalog
Many questions about law school can be answered online. The Law School Admissions Council (LSAC) o9ers
the Law School Admission Test (LSAT) which is generally required for law school applications. Infomation about
the test and other aspects of law school can be found on the LSAC website. Students interested in discussing
career options and how they might prepare for law school are invited to contact Associate Dean Rissmiller in
the Global School.



Pre-Health Programs
ADVISORS: E. Jacoby, A. Holmes
Students at WPI who wish to pursue careers in the health professions (e.g. medicine, dentistry, veterinary
medicine, etc.) should, in consultation with their academic advisors, plan their academic programs to include
courses in biology, general and organic chemistry, biochemistry, and physics including laboratory experiences.
Although required courses for certain majors will naturally overlap with professional school prerequisites more
than others, entry into medical or other health professions schools may be accomplished through any major
program of study. It is important for students to work closely with their faculty advisors as well as the pre-health
advisor to formulate an academic plan of study that will include the courses required for admission to health
professions schools while still allowing for completion of all degree requirements. Individual admissions
requirements will vary by school and program. Students should consult admissions websites of individual health
professions programs for speci<c information about prerequisites. Pre-med students are encouraged to consult
the Medical School Admissions Requirement (MSAR) resource.

WPI’s project-focused curriculum o9ers a tremendous advantage to pre-health students. Health professions
programs value teamwork, as well as cross-cultural, research, and community service experience, all of which
can be demonstrated through project work. Because students will graduate from WPI with a degree in an
academic discipline, they will have other career opportunities should they decide not to pursue a career in a
health profession or should they choose to work for some time after graduation before continuing on to a health
professions school. Students and alumni applying to health professions schools should plan to meet with the
pre-health advisor to discuss the application process and arrange a letter of recommendation from the pre-
health committee (if required) to support their application. Such meetings should ideally begin during a
student’s <rst year as an undergraduate student (or as soon as a student decides to pursue this path) and
continue through their time at WPI.



Teacher Preparation Program
Advisor: Jillian DiBonaventura
Licensed teachers in STEM <elds are in continual high demand across the United States. Participation and
successful completion of our teacher preparation program will result in obtaining an Initial teaching licensure in
the state of Massachusetts. WPI students may elect to pursue licensure in middle or high school mathematics,
middle school general science, high school science (Biology, Chemistry, Physics), or technology/engineering
while obtaining an undergraduate degree in the STEM-related major of their choice.

Speci<c content courses are required to meet Massachusetts requirements for Subject Matter Knowledge
competency, but these are generally met by courses in a student's major. Joining this certi<cate program
enables participants to pursue the content are of their choice while impacting the lives of middle and high
school students in urban schools and the local community. Students wishing to discuss this option further are
encouraged to contact Jillian DiBonaventura, Director of Teacher Preparation at the STEM Education Center.

Applications are accepted via eProjects twice yearly (B and C term), and more information can be found on our
website or by contacting www.wpi.edu/+teach

ROTC

Military Science
LTC Joseph T. Mazzocchi
PROFESSOR: LTC Joseph Mazzocchi

ASSISTANT PROFESSOR: MAJ Daniel Gimm, CPT Patrick Crews

INSTRUCTORS: MSG James Conley, MSG Charles Dougherty, SFC Donald Vota


Mission Statement:
The Military Science and Leadership Program (Army ROTC) is a premiere leadership program o9ered by WPI.
Open to all students within the Worcester Consortium, the program teaches valuable leadership skills and
managerial traits that prepare students for careers in both the private and public sectors. Students partake in
hands-on experiences that integrate traditional coursework with innovative training. Students develop strong
decision-making and organizational management skills, while cultivating team-building and interpersonal skills,
as well as mastering time and stress management techniques.


Objectives and Outcomes:
WPI’s Army ROTC prepares multi-faceted future leaders. Students who participate in Army ROTC while
pursuing their undergraduate and graduate studies are extremely marketable and highly sought after for their
problem-solving and adaptable capabilities. As technology continues to transform organizations and
corporations, ROTC students are at the forefront of these cutting-edge developments.


Program Descriptions:
The Military Science and Leadership program is intended to be a four-year program which encourages personal
growth and cultivates overall character development.




95                                                                                        WPI 2023-24 Catalog
A. The Basic Course:
The Basic Course serves as the foundation of the Army ROTC program and is taken over the <rst two years. The
focal points of the Basic Course are leadership, teambuilding and communication skills. Students participate in
adventure training (such as orienteering, rappelling and paintball) to put classroom teachings and core concept-
strategies to practice.

Students may participate in the <rst two years of the program commitment free. Students awarded full-tuition
scholarships or who participate in the Advanced Course (described below) incur a service obligation and may
serve in the Army either full-time or part-time.

B. Advanced Course:
The Advanced Course is a more intensive leadership program that is taken during the Junior and Senior years,
or, during two years of graduate studies. The curriculum continues its focus on problem-solving and team
building exercises while incorporating military tactics and Ethics.

Student interested in earning a commission as an Army O:cer are required to enroll in the Advanced Camp (AC)
at Ft Knox, Kentucky. AC is a six-week leadership and tactical course that students are paid to attend during the
summer; it is the culmination of the students’ training over their tenure on campus. If students decide later in
their academic career that they would like to pursue Army ROTC, there are alternate entry options that allow
them to receive Basic Course credit and to prepare them for Advanced Camp (1).

Students attending on an Army ROTC Scholarship receive a yearly book-allowance of $1,200 in addition to a
monthly stipend. Both “scholarship” and “contracted, non-scholarship” students receive a monthly stipend of
$420.00. Students interested in pursuing scholarships or enrolling in the Advanced Course must meet speci<c
eligibility requirements.



Air Force Aerospace Studies
LT COL C. CUDE, DEPARTMENT HEAD
PROFESSOR: Lt Col C. Cude

ASSISTANT PROFESSORS: Maj K. Blackman, Capt C. Rouleau


Mission
The mission of AFROTC is to develop leaders of character for tomorrow’s Air Force and Space Force. The
mission of the United States Air Force is to =y, <ght and win...airpower anytime, anywhere. The United States
Space Force (USSF) is a military service that organizes, trains, and equips space forces in order to protect U.S.
and allied interests in space and to provide space capabilities to the joint force. Successful graduates of the
program receive a commission as a Second Lieutenant in the United States Air Force or Space Force.


Educational Objectives
Students who successfully complete the AFROTC program will develop:

 1.   An understanding of the fundamental concepts and principles of Air and Space.
 2.   A basic understanding of associated professional knowledge.
 3.   A strong sense of personal integrity, honor, and individual responsibility.
 4.   An appreciation of the requirements for national security.


Air Force ROTC Programs
There are two traditional routes to an Air Force commission through Air Force ROTC. Entering students may
enroll in the Air Force Four-Year Program. Students with at least three academic years remaining in college may
apply for the Accelerated Program.




96                                                                                            WPI 2023-24 Catalog
Four- or Five-Year Program
The preferred program is the traditional Four-Year Program. To enroll, simply register for Air Force Aerospace
Studies in the fall term of the freshman year in the same manner as other college courses. There is NO
MILITARY OBLIGATION for the <rst two years of Air Force ROTC unless you have an Air Force ROTC scholarship.

The <rst two years are known as the General Military Course (GMC). Classes meet one hour per week and are
required for freshmen and sophomores.

Individuals who successfully complete the GMC compete nationwide for entry into the Professional O:cers
Course (POC). POC classes meet three hours per week and are required for all juniors and seniors. O:cer
Candidates enrolled in the POC and on scholarship receive a nontaxable subsistence allowance of up to $500
each month.

Quali<ed O:cer candidates will attend the Air Force ROTC <eld-training program for four weeks, usually
between their sophomore and junior years.


Accelerated Program
For students who do not enroll in Air Force ROTC during their <rst year in college, it is possible to condense the
two years of GMC membership into a single year, as long as the student has three more years of college left.


Other Aspects of the AFROTC Program
Leadership Laboratory:
Air Force ROTC o:cer candidates participate in a Leadership Laboratory (LLAB) where the leadership skills and
management theories acquired in the classroom are put into practice. The LLAB meets once each week for
approximately two hours.

This formal military training is largely planned and directed by the o:cer candidates. The freshmen and
sophomores are involved in such initial leadership experiences as problem solving, dynamic leadership, team
building, Air Force customs and courtesies, drill movements, Air Force educational bene<ts, Air Force career
opportunities, and preparation for <eld training. The juniors and seniors are involved in more advanced
leadership experiences as they become responsible for the planning and organizing of wing activities, including
conducting the Leadership Laboratory itself.

Field Training:
The summer program is designed to develop military leadership, discipline, and evaluate performance. At the
same time, the Air Force can evaluate each student’s potential as an o:cer. Field training includes: expeditionary
operations, Air Force professional development, marksmanship training, physical <tness, and survival training.

Base Visits:
Air Force ROTC o:cer candidates may have the opportunity to visit Air Force bases for <rsthand observation of
the operating Air Force.

Additional Information:
